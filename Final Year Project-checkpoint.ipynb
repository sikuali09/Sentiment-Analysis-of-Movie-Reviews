       " b\"good films are hard to find these days . \\ngreat films are beyond rare . \\nproof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . \\na taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . \\nconsider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . \\ni haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . \\nbut enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . \\nthe film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . \\nupon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . \\nthe only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . \\nwith no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . \\nbut when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . \\nthe film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . \\nthe script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . \\nthe biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . \\ndug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . \\nryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . \\nthe most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . \\nthe bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . \\nthe scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . \\ndirector taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . \\nproof of life is a thinking man's action movie . \\nit is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . \\n\",\n",

       " b'gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit . \\nin fact , they\\'ve been around in books and on film for many , many years . \\nwithout the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated . \\n \" the gift , \" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . \\nit\\'s fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . \\nthe film ultimately shouldn\\'t work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . \\nannie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . \\nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he\\'s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . \\nfor annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone\\'s future . \\nher late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . \\nwhen annie\\'s eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . \\nbut wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . \\nat a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . \\nsoon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \\n \" the gift \" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999\\'s \" for love of the game \" ) lift the picture up several notches . \\nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie\\'s true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . \\nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999\\'s \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . \\nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . \\nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . \\nblanchett isn\\'t the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . \\nin her first role following her oscar win for 1999\\'s \" boys don\\'t cry , \" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . \\nas donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000\\'s \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . \\nfor the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . \\ngiovanni ribisi ( 2000\\'s \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . \\nin the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000\\'s \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . \\nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . \\nfinally , kim dickens ( 2000\\'s \" hollow man \" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie\\'s spicy best friend , linda . \\nthe other notable aspect of \" the gift \" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it\\'s almost suffocating . \\nthanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread . \\nhelped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , \" the gift \" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too . \\nit may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time . \\n',\n",
       " b\"what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . \\nsometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . \\nthe thin red line is flawed but it provokes . \\nterence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . \\nunlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . \\nwhile that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . \\nsaving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . \\none message is not necessarily more correct than the other . \\nit just depends on one's point of view . \\nin malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush . \\nthe setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? \\nin saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . \\nin the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . \\nthey are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . \\nall that separates them is war . \\nthe flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs . \\nunbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . \\ndispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . \\ninstead , he gets distracting self-consciousness . \\naside from that , malick's direction is stunning . \\nthe tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . \\nsean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . \\npenn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle . \\njohn travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . \\nultimately however , the thin red line's interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama . \\nit has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . \\nhas no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? \\nwhat malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking . \\n\",\n",

       " b'bill condon\\'s \" gods and monsters \" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics \" frankenstein \" and \" bride of frankenstein . \" \\nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale\\'s inner fantasies and hallucinations . \\nwhale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . \\nas the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . \\njames whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , \" a dirty old man . \" \\nin one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale\\'s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . \\nbecause of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . \\nclayon agrees , and doesn\\'t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . \\ncertainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a \" motion picture director , \" rather than a \" horror director . \" \\nand in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . \\nit is evident that whale\\'s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . \\nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . \\nhe never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . \\nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . \\nalthough boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people\\'s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . \\nsince whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . \\nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . \\nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the \" on-again-off-again \" friendship at the film\\'s center is fairly predictable . \\nwe know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . \\nin lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . \\nalso , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . \\nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . \\nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . \\nwalking away from \" gods and monsters , \" it was ian mckellen\\'s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . \\nit is a sad testament when a person\\'s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else\\'s business in the first place . \\n',\n",

they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . \\nbut in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . \\ncrows tear out the eyes of cinderella\\'s sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . \\nhansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . \\nwriters have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . \\nbefore this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years . \\nin the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . \\nthe story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose \\'real\\' life we learn very little . \\nwithin the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen\\'s grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . \\nthe result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . \\ni say \" surprisingly \" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . \\nand there are ways in which it does . \\nthe performances are mediocre , except for lansbury\\'s--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . \\nthe soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . \\nprobably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable . \\nbut jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . \\none of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the \\'realism\\' of the screen . \\npart of me would love to see an adaptation of \\'the lord of the rings , \\' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker\\'s recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . \\nthis makes jordan\\'s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . \\nthe somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality . \\nthe sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . \\nthe nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . \\nthe peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . \\nthis archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you\\'d expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . \\nfor carter , the cauldron of story is a witches\\' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . \\nshe adeptly blends them all together . \\nthere is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance . \\nthe point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl\\'s rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level . \\na night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother\\'s home , is the crux of the company of wolves . \\n \" don\\'t stray from the path , \" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life . \\nstaying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen\\'s elders . \\ncarter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path . \\nthose who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate . \\nthis fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge . \\nif straying from the path leads to death , then it\\'s not a good idea--but if that\\'s what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it\\'s worth the risk . \\nwhen you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it\\'s full of potential . \\nand it\\'s certainly more interesting than the disney version . \\n',\n",

\\ni couldn\\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \\nthat\\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\\'t . \\nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \\nthe first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\\'s including mr . \\nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \\nwowzers ! \\nwhat a r ? sum ? ! \\nlooking at the names , you\\'d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\\'s . \\nwell that\\'s not all . \\nthis guy also brought us 90\\'s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \\nvegas vacation , however , didn\\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \\nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \\nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \\nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\\'s not . \\nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \\nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \\nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\\'s quite out of place . \\nstephen kessler\\'s jejune direction doesn\\'t help things either . \\nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \\neach consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \\nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \\nnot too bad . \\nthen we had national lampoon\\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \\nlastly we had national lampoon\\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \\nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \\ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \\nif you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\\'t anything here worth seeing . \\nif you loved them , don\\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . \\nif you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?

       " b'on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento\\'s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . \\nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . \\nwhile it\\'s certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . \\nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . \\nwith the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . \\nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . \\nhe brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . \\nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . \\nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . \\ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento\\'s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . \\nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . \\nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . \\nneedless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director\\'s brilliance as a stylist . \\nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . \\nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . \\ninstead , tenebrae\\'s set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . \\nand the soundtrack\\'s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . \\nso tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . \\nstill , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . \\nsome critics argue that logic doesn\\'t matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don\\'t deserve to feel cheated . \\nby the way , if you don\\'t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . \\nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . \\nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . \\nhe is insane , apparently . \\nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it\\'s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . \\nhe is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film\\'s bloody climax . \\nbut argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . \\nyou see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer\\'s house . \\nbut thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . \\nbad cutting puts the timing way out . \\nin other words , he\\'s almost in two places at once . \\nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . \\nby the film\\'s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . \\nthe injury ? \\nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! \\nthus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . \\nhelpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . \\nbut there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . \\nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosa\\'s mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . \\ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . \\nfor instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . \\nwe would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren\\'t even introduced too ! \\nthat\\'s careless filmmaking , pure and simple . \\nwhy , you may ask , do i go on about the story\\'s flaws ?

       " b'the idea at the center of the devil\\'s advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- \" the last humanist \" . \\nhe appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , \" vanity -- by far my favorite sin \" . \\nal pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( \" lemme givya a piece o\\' inside wisdom on god . . . \" , \" i have a million names . . . \" ) , as john milton -- the devil . \\nthe main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam\\'s the time bandits . \\nbut the film , is something else , something original . \\npart of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn\\'t try to become any profound study of power . \\nthis is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking . \\nit is also entertaining . \\nthere is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind\\'s eye . \\nthe final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen\\'s fargo . \\nthe central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james\\' the turn of the screw , and oates\\' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows . \\nits nice to know that things like this are still being made . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" mandingo \" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , \" a trashy potboiler \" that \" appeals only to the s&m crowd . \" \\nactually , i think \" mandingo \" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . \\nit\\'s too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . \\nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . \\none day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . \\nalthough the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . \\naccording to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . \\nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . \\nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . \\nmeanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . \\nhammond , however , is happier spending nights with his \" bed wench , \" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . \\nit is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . \\nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had \" pleasured \" her before he did . \\nof course , it\\'s fine that he\\'s slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a \" white lady , \" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . \\nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . \\nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . \\nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it\\'s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . \\nhammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . \\nyes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . \\njudging only by the plot , \" mandingo \" is pure sexploitation . \\nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \\nwhen \" mandingo \" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \\ndramatically , \" mandingo \" is weak and unfocused , and historically it\\'s mostly confused . \\nif one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . \\nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . \\nthe men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . \\nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but \" mandingo\\'s \" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there\\'s plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . \\nsome tried to write off \" mandingo \" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it\\'s not that easy . \\n \" mandingo \" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as \" the bible \" ( 1966 ) , the remake of \" king kong \" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated \" dune \" ( 1984 ) . \\nthe director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" ( 1954 ) and \" fantastic voyage \" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as \" the narrow margin \" ( 1952 ) . \\nthe script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on \" serpico . \" \\njames mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \\nso why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \\na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \\nwexler\\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut\\'re you gittin\\' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \\nfleischer\\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \\nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \\ndespite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \\nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \\neven classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \\n \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \\nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \\nwith a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \\nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \\nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \\nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \\nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \\nthe difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \\n \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \\n',\n",

\\nlook at what i can do ! \\ni\\'m an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . \" \\nmaybe then he\\'d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . \\nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn\\'t see it . \\njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . \\narrrrrrrghhhh . \\n . \\n . \\nthen again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn\\'t bother me if \" stigmata \" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . \\nthough wainwright\\'s vanity certainly doesn\\'t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . \\nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? \\ncase in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren\\'t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . \\nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she\\'s kind of cute , so let\\'s start the bleeding ! \\nthe fact that she\\'s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn\\'t help , either . \\naccording to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? \\ngo clubbing ! \\nsure , that makes sense . \\narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \\nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \\neven though frankie page\\'s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \\neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \\nfather andrew\\'s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \\nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i\\'ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \\ntrust me , i\\'m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \\nwhat\\'s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \\nfirst of all , the film doesn\\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \\nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \\nactually , i\\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \\nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \\nwhich one is it ? \\nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \\nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \\nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \\nthere\\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \\n \" stigmata\\'s \" religion is so off-base that it can\\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \\nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \\ni\\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \\nit\\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \\ni\\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \\nmaybe it\\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \\nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \\nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \\nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\\'s ( many ) flaws . \\ni\\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \\nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \\nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \\n',\n",
       " b'reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \\nthe guy can\\'t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \\nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \\ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \\nit\\'s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \\nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \\nauteur theory be damned ; it\\'s kruger\\'s \" style \" , not the director\\'s that winds up on screen . \\nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . \\nand his numerous twists can\\'t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd\\'s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol\\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn\\'t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar \\nbe damned ) . \\n \" how did you know that ? \" \\nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \\n . \\n . \\nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger\\'s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it\\'s no wonder why he works so frequently . \\nhe\\'s quickly becoming miramax\\'s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \\nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \\ntheir company\\'s current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . \\nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \\nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \\naffleck is such a puppy dog that it\\'s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone\\'s bitch . \\nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . \\nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who\\'s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \\njames frain is nick , rudy\\'s cellmate , a manslaughterer who\\'s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \\nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she\\'s never seen one picture of him . \\nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley\\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \\nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \\nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i\\'ve described might as well be irrelevant . \\nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \\nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \\nthough it\\'s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \\nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \\nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \\n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \\nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \\nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \\ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \\nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \\nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \\ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \\nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \\ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \\nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \\n',\n",
       " b'most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy . \\nrocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category , but manages to be slightly unique . \\nthe rocky formula of \" rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight \" is carried out to the letter . \\nalso the \\'tradition\\' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well . \\nthis movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become . . . \\neven showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! ! \\nthen it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan ) . \\na mysterious bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash-talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he \" pities the fool \" for not coming out and fighting him outright . \\nrocky\\'s trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not to fight , but the italian stallion doesn\\'t listen . \\nnaturally , he gets his ass kicked . \\nsomewhere along the line after this several things happen . \\nrocky\\'s longtime trainer dies , causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed . \\nrocky\\'s wife complains to her husband that he should fight . \\nthe final fight ensues between clubber and rocky . \\nguess who wins ? \\nthe winner\\'s name rhymes with \\'smocky\\' . \\nthe movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang\\'s over the top performance . \\nthe dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film . \\nwhich is good if you like fighting scenes . \\nthe last match is quite decent actually . \\nif you liked the previous films , rent this one . \\nit\\'s well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series . \\nbut if you can\\'t stand rocky shouting \" adrianne ! ! ! \" \\none more time , see something else . \\n',\n",
       " b\"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . \\nthis slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . \\nwhen the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . \\nupon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . \\nas the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . \\ndid dolores kill her husband ? \\nand did she kill her employer ? \\ndolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . \\nconsequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . \\nkathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . \\ndolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . \\nshe dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . \\nkathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . \\nthe rest of the cast is also very good . \\njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . \\ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . \\njudy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . \\nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . \\nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . \\nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . \\nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . \\nhowever , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . \\nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . \\nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . \\nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . \\ndolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . \\nhowever , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . \\non my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . \\n\",\n",
       " b'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \\nwell , whatever it is , you\\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\\'re left with here . \\nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \\nit\\'s like i said . . . this \\nmovie sucks . \\nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \\ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \\nuneven , would be another . \\nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it\\'s actually going to go \" somewhere \" . \\nbut it isn\\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the \" pain \" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \\nin a sci-fi movie ? \\nwell , i don\\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \\nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their \" misadventures in space \" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \\nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \\nof course , i don\\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \\nugh . \\nwhat a friggin\\' mess . \\nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \\ndidn\\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \\ndidn\\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\\'t saying much ! ) . \\nof course , you can\\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \\n\\'nuff said . \\nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \\nears hurt ! ) . \\nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \\nsure . \\ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the \" sand-twister \" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \\nother than that ? \\ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , \\ndid i say \" admire \" , i meant \" am disgusted \" ! \\nall in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \\ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \\nthere\\'s a great movie ! \\nand on a personal note , i think it\\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \\n',\n",

       " b\"to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film . \\ndespite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence . \\never since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage . \\nthe perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films . \\n`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause . \\nbut who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' . \\ncage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day . \\nafter five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends . \\nhe also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york . \\nfrank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow . . . ' he promises ) . \\nfrank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance . \\nthe first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain . \\nthe second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation . \\nand finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood . \\ni found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot . \\neach is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality . \\nthe one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack . \\narquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage . \\nit's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale . \\nthe movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' . \\nalthough it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture . \\nthe incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration . \\nfans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' . \\ndoes `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ? \\nonly occasionally . \\nsome of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice . \\nthose expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort . \\n`bringing out the dead' was written by the acclaimed paul schrader , who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver' and `raging bull' . \\nschrader's script is full of moments - wonderful , sharply defined moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay . \\nthe exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding technical credits and the amazing cast . \\ngoodman and sizemore are both electric ( well , mainly sizemore ) , but it's the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look . \\nwatch the actor's deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member , and you'll understand why he won a golden globe . \\n`bringing out the dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it's certain flaws . \\nscorsese - and cage , for that matter - have done better , but their intentions are certainly admirable . \\n\",\n",

one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them . \\nshe gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand . \\n ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers . \\nunfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale . \\naloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again . \\nbad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles . \\naloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise . \\nthis decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by . \\nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral . \\nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly . \\nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind . \\nworst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival . \\nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death . \\nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? \\nwill patrasche save the day ? \\nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? \\na dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages . \\neven older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too . \\nthere have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself . \\nmove over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight . \\nthe cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film . \\nit also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) . \\nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century . \\nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) . \\nthe cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) . \\nnot that they are the only good stars , however . \\njack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character . \\n ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . ) \\nalso , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william . \\nhe's another one of my favorite characters in the film . \\nbut jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel . \\nhe brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest . \\nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters . \\nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff . \\nthis one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama . \\nthat , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful . \\neleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders . \\nits heart is in the right place and it engages you . \\nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . ' \\nin addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) . \\nother critics , however , were not so kind . \\nstephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing . \\nhe found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . ' \\nin addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . ' \\nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this , too . \\nmy suggestion : disregard the critics . \\nthey just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them . \\nthis dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself . \\nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders . \\nit is also one of the better family films around this year . \\nnone of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching . \\nif you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn . \\ngo see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time . \\nsee it while you can . \\nthere is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie . \\n\",\n",

       " b'the main problem with martin lawrence\\'s pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn\\'t seem to do anything except justify the woman\\'s actions . \\nthat is especially the case in lawrence\\'s darnell wright . \\nhe is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long . \\nnow don\\'t think i condone this just because i\\'m male . \\nmy philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her . \\ndarnell doesn\\'t think like this . \\nhe sleeps with these girls once and dumps them . \\nand by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , \" i\\'m supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? \" \\nafter all , it is largely darnell\\'s fault . \\nif he is lining up all these women , you\\'d think he\\'d have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does . \\nbut he doesn\\'t , so you get the sense that he\\'s not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb . \\nyou especially get this sense that he\\'s dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her . \\n ( i\\'d put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ) \\nnow , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it\\'s hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage . \\none final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with . \\nbrandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell\\'s \" immature play \" as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life . \\nbut all of a sudden she says yes . \\nbut when you listen to darnell\\'s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him ! \\nlawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies . \\nlook at this movie . \\nfour writers , as a result it\\'s too long ( two hours , when it could\\'ve easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn\\'t get along ) , all of which isn\\'t necessary . \\nthere are some bright spots , though . \\nwhitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot . \\nand there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they\\'re just not enough to sustain the film . \\n',\n",
       " b\"the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\nthat's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . \\nsuch an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . \\none need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . \\nthe trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . \\nyou will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . \\nthose who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . \\nothers will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . \\nlawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . \\ndangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . \\nsherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . \\nindeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . \\nthat leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . \\nbig momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . \\ndoubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . \\nunfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . \\nsuspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . \\nof course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . \\nand it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . \\nunfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . \\nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . \\nhe's just big momma without the makeup on . \\ni won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . \\nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . \\ni'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . \\nthe gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . \\nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . \\nbig momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . \\nit's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\n\",\n",

       " b'steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and \" oscar \" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler\\'s list . \\nhowever , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . \\none of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . \\nunfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . \\nalthough both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . \\nwhen spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws . \\ntogether with other young directors of his \" new hollywood \" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . \\nironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of \" blockubuster \" philosophy . \\nbut in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . \\nalthough very personal , spielberg\\'s screenplay was partly based on the book \" ufo experience \" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . \\nspielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary . \\nthat was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot . \\nthe story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . \\nsuch events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience . \\nbecause of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . \\nin the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project . \\nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . \\nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . \\ntwo of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . \\nspielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . \\nthe slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - \" close encounters \" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . \\nbut , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . \\nthroughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . \\nthe last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open . \\none of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . \\naliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . \\nit is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks\\' thing and byron haskin\\'s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . \\nspielberg\\'s humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . \\nbut , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . \\nthere lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama . \\nthe movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock\\'s north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys . \\ndespite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . \\nrichard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . \\nmelinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for \" oscar \" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary\\'s long-suffering wife ronnie . \\napart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg\\'s semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score . \\nthe aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing . \\ntoo convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said . \\naccording to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . \\nso , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life . \\nthe result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . \\nanyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema . \\n',\n",
       " b'according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors \" hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . \" \\nhmm . \\nyou never know , they just might be on to something . \\nwhat with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own . \\nbut then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it . \\nit\\'s cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch . \\nthat\\'s a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more . \\nwoody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson . \\nthe movie opens in the fifties with roy\\'s dad dishing out the reader\\'s digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever . \\nthe sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken . \\nit\\'s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy . \\nmccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy\\'s hand . \\nthen it\\'s fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand . \\nhe\\'s hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege . \\nso together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way . \\nwith the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that\\'s . . . \\ndumb and dumber . \\nyes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle . \\nso , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen . \\nget set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking . \\nnow , don\\'t get me wrong , there\\'s nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy . \\nthe trouble is that these jokes aren\\'t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction . \\nit lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together . \\nsome gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don\\'t do anything . \\nwhy the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? \\nwhy two of these ? \\nwhy does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? \\nthe film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , \" wouldn\\'t that be funny ? \" . \\nwell , no , actually . \\nthe actors don\\'t do the movie much favours either . \\nwoody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . . please \\n ) . \\neven murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie\\'s climax . \\nall in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance . \\nwe\\'ll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( \" strictly bowling \" , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n",
       " b'of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom \\nthe opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film . \\nthere\\'s a guy\\'s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women . \\nas his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy . \\nit\\'s not just a witty , funny summing up of the film \\'s themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on . \\nwhat starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash . \\nthat may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn\\'t , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow . \\nvarious mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow . \\nbut if you think you\\'ve been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension . \\nthe dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn\\'t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech . \\nwhether it\\'s about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention . \\nthe best thing is how these words aren\\'t just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they\\'re said in character , like tea leoni\\'s neurotically-charged psychobabbler who\\'s able to say under assault , \" it\\'s understandable if you find this threatening \" . \\nthe cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission . \\nthere are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) . \\nlike allen , russell\\'s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) . \\nstill , if you\\'re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la \" murphy brown \" / \" frasier \" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won\\'t happen . \\nthe film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character\\'s search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down . \\nif the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster\\'s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go . \\nand that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it . \\nsomehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end . \\n',\n",

\\nultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . \\nwhat does god really think of us ? \\ndoes he resent our abandonment of paradise ? \\nwho exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? \\nif you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . \\nas for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . \\ncarrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn\\'t try to be . \\nhe just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us . \\n',\n",

tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . \\nbelieving at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . \\nhis minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he\\'s a nut , that doesn\\'t mean that he can\\'t solve a high-profile society murder . \\nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus\\'s \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane\\'s urban noir hero , spawn . \\nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy

\\nthat being said , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \\nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane\\'s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \\nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus\\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \\nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \\nit , along with m . night shyamalan\\'s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller\\'s seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \\nreaders of sam keith\\'s brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv\\'s short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \\nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america\\'s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \\nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer\\'s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \\nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve\\'s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \\nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot\\'s rat\\'s alley wasteland . \\n',\n",

       " b\"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \\nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \\nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \\nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \\ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \\nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . \\ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \\nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \\nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . \\nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \\nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \\nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \\naudiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \\nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \\nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \\ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \\nwhat he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . \\na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \\nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . \\nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \\ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \\nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \\nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \\nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \\nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \\nit doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \\nthere's a word for people like you , nicolas . \\nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \\noffender . \\n\",\n",
       " b'film adaptation of hunter s . thompson\\'s infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . \\ndirector terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) \\n \" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie \" , according to gilliam . \\nplot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . \\nduring their trip , they systematically consume \" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . \\nthe movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . \\ncritique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer\\'s own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . \\nif you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . \\nif , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture\\'s entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . \\nnote : i have not read thompson\\'s book . \\nhaving said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . \\nthis movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . \\nit moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . \\nit was 1971 , and the times were apparently \" a\\' changing \" in the states . \\njohnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . \\nduring the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . \\ni thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . \\nthe one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . \\ni couldn\\'t believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \\nword on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . \\nplenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . \\nother than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . \\nthis movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . \\nand for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . \\nlittle known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . \\nbill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . \\njohnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what\\'s eating gilbert grape ? \\n ( 7/10 ) . \\nin 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he\\'d tried every drug by the age of 14 . \\njohnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now . \\njohnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself \" mr . stench \" , has been engaged to four women until now ( including actress winona ryder , whose \" winona forever \" tattoo had to be altered to \" wino forever \" after their breakup ) , currently plays guitar in a band called \" p \" , and owns the viper room nightclub in l . a . \\n',\n",
       " b'as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left . \\nfirst , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : \" if you liked scream , you\\'ll love wild things ! \" \\n \" campbell gives a stunning performance ! \" \\n \" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! \" \\n ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) \\nnow , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) . \\nwild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa . \\ni\\'m not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see . \\nhowever , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film\\'s charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating . \\nbeing mormon , i\\'m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film . \\ntrouble is , i have already seen it . \\nand i like it ! \\nwild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . \\nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color . \\nthe actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film . \\nsure , it\\'s all too good to be true , but ain\\'t it fun to watch ? \\nwhen movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . \\nthere will be people who don\\'t want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . \\nwild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . \\nit\\'s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . \\nof course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . \\nimmediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . \\nwe can turn off our brains , right ? \\nwrong . \\nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn\\'t turn out that way . \\nthe film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . \\nthere\\'s sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . \\nhe\\'s heading the class discussion . \\nthere\\'s also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . \\nteaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about \\'sex . . . \\n ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) \\' . \\n \" what is a sex crime ? \" \\nray asks . \\n \" not gettin\\' any ! \" \\none student responds . \\nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . \\nhowever , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . \\nand so , wild things sets into motion . \\nquickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn\\'t want anything to do with her advances . \\nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . \\nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . \\nsurprisingly , that\\'s really all i can tell you about the plot . \\nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . \\nand what\\'s more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . \\ngoing along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film\\'s surprises , and then adds even more to them . \\nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . \\nand even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it\\'s rather pleasing . \\ngoing back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . \\nthankfully , the convoluted plot doesn\\'t give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . \\nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is . \\nthis is pretty much just one trashy film . \\nhowever , it is the kind of trashy that isn\\'t hard to watch . \\nit\\'s good trash , in a sense . \\none , the screenplay knows that it\\'s not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . \\nthis varies everywhere from kelly\\'s mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . \\nbill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . \\nand two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . \\nwild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn\\'t ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . \\ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don\\'t worry . . . \\nit\\'s not as graphic as you might think ) . \\nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon\\'s full-frontal nude scene . \\nit\\'s very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . \\nand , for as long as i can remember , i don\\'t think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it\\'s not completely , but judging from the audiences\\' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . \\nalso , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon\\'s characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . \\nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast . \\nneve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . \\nhere , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . \\nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . \\ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . \\nyou can tell she will be around for a long time . \\ndenise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . \\nhere , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . \\nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . \\nand then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . \\nshe gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . \\ntowards the end she does get a bigger part . \\non the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . \\nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . \\nyou must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . \\nand judging from many of the women\\'s reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . \\nand then there is bill murray . \\nhis performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . \\nas a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . \\ndirector john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . \\nhis direction is smooth and stylish . \\nthe visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . \\nhowever , he seems more at home when the actors aren\\'t talking . \\nhis fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards\\' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . \\nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . \\nthen , there is the music . \\nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . \\nit\\'s hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . \\nit\\'s wonderfully composed and presented . \\nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! \\nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . \\nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . \\nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it\\'s an entertaining way to finish the film . \\nplus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . \\nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . \\nagain , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let\\'s face it--people want to see it . \\nso why not give it to them ? \\nneve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . \\nthe sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . \\none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . \\nthe language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . \\nand i can\\'t stress it enough : don\\'t allow kids under 18 to see this film . \\nthe target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that\\'s who should see it . \\nit\\'s definitely not for those under 18 ! \\ndid i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time . \\n',\n",

! ) . \\nfinally , just one word : monsters . \\nfaye dunaway and peter o\\'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o\\'toole overacts he\\'s entertaining and when dunaway does it she\\'s annoying ( her character actually says the line \" seize them ! \" \\nat one point ) . \\ndunaway\\'s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty\\'s otis character from the first two superman movies . \\nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she\\'s written to be , as she\\'s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \\nbelievability aside though , it\\'s still annoying . \\nnow despite all this negativity ( and i\\'m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \\nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \\nyet i\\'m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \\nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \\nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \\nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and \" special project consultant \" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \\nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \\nyou\\'d think you were watching a new release . \\nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \\nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn\\'t much that can be done about that ( unless you\\'re obsessive like george lucas ) . \\nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you\\'ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams\\' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films\\' golan-globus production ) . \\nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \\nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there\\'s no dead air on the track . \\nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \\nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn\\'t get that response . \\nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the \" almost \" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \\ngreat detail is given about superman\\'s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \\nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \\nfor the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense . \\nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \\nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \\ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \\ndisc two features the never before seen director\\'s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \\nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don\\'t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o\\'toole\\'s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \\nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won\\'t care . \\none question though . . . \\nshouldn\\'t the director\\'s commentary be on the director\\'s cut of the film ? \\ni\\'d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \\ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \\nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \\ni knew the film wasn\\'t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \\nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \\ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \\nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \\nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \\nugh , i give up . \\ni\\'m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \\nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \\n[pg] \\n',\n",

tense moment again . \\nit is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . \\nthis creates some strange effects . \\nthe stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . \\nthe strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . \\nwe have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . \\nphil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . \\npartridge\\'s young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as

\\neach story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . \\nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . \\nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in

by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . \\nso while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . \\nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a

       " b'a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . \\na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . \\na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . \\na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . \\nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . \\nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . \\nedward zwick\\'s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . \\nyou\\'d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . \\narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . \\nhowever , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden\\'s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . \\nin retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . \\nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau\\'s new york office at one federal plaza . \\nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . \\ngenerally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . \\neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . \\nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . \\nthe original tagline for patriot games was , \" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . \" \\nhowever true , it was pulled before the movie\\'s release because it sounded too much like a dare . \\nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . \\nadmittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who\\'s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . \\ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . \\nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . \\nin fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . \\nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . \\nthroughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . \\nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . \\nit actually gets rather heady at times , but it\\'s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don\\'t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . \\ni don\\'t know if it\\'s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . \\nthis , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . \\nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i\\'ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . \\nit\\'s somewhat unfortunate that her character\\'s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . \\nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . \\nhowever , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film\\'s development . \\nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . \\nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . \\ndifficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . \\nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom \" wings , \" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . \\nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick\\'s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . \\ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner\\'s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . \\nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . \\nit\\'s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we\\'ve been getting throughout the year . \\nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . \\nfor example , it\\'s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . \\nunfortunately , there\\'s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . \\nin the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . \\nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . \\nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . \\na noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . \\nthese flaws are glaring , but they don\\'t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . \\n',\n",

       " b'one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i\\'ve given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey\\'s gone and become a jaded critic on us . \\njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n\\' roll movie like this ? \" \\ni\\'m wondering the same thing . \\ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \\nit\\'s the sort of movie i wish i could\\'ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn\\'t . \\ni just didn\\'t . \\nsurely this film isn\\'t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \\nno , but i expected something . \\na funny joke . \\na clever prank . \\na plot development . \\nanything . \\nthe movie never delivers . \\nyou\\'ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \\n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film\\'s existence , and it\\'s not a very satisfying realization . \\nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \\nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \\nthey have a garage band . \\nthey\\'re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n\\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \\nthey have tickets , they lose them . \\nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \\nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \\nthere\\'s not much more to it . \\nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys\\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \\noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \\nshe doesn\\'t want them to see kiss , if you hadn\\'t figured that out already . \\nit\\'s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \\nwe\\'ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \\nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \\n \" detroit rock city \" doesn\\'t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \\nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \\nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc\\'s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor\\'s cat coughed up ) . \\nit\\'s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it\\' s evident that they\\'re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \\nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they\\'ve got to make a living in hollywood . \\npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \\ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \\ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn\\'t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \\nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \\nit\\'s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \\ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \\ni haven\\'t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \\nand what about that script ? \\nit\\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\\'ve ever heard . \\nif it is , i can\\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \\na plotless , pointless rock n\\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \\nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \\nit\\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \\nfunny ! \" \\nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \\ntwice . \\nsee ?

       " b'i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \\nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \\nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \\nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what\\'s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \\ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \\nif you\\'ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don\\'t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \\nthe problem we come to is that we\\'ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn\\'t break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \\nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \\ni\\'m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \\nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn\\'t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \\njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . \\nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you\\'d think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \\nwell , you\\'d be wrong . \\nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \\nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \\nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what\\'s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \\nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \\none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \\nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn\\'t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \\ni\\'ll tell you why : because it\\'s a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones\\' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \\nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \\none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he\\'ll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \\ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it\\'ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" \\nwe know jon , it\\'s called editing . \\n',\n",
       " b'seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \\nwar is a topic that can\\'t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . \\nmovies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . \\nit\\'s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . \\nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . \\n \" saving private ryan \" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . \\nit proves there\\'s a huge difference between battling and killing . \\nthe film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . \\nit\\'s world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . \\nspielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . \\ninstead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . \\nthere is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \\n \" poor \" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . \\nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . \\nwe don\\'t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . \\nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they\\'re there . \\nin the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn\\'t happen . \\nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . \\nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they\\'re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . \\nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . \\nthe film seems to rely on the audience\\'s sense of patriotism , that the american military is \" right \" and good and that the nazis are \" inherently evil . \" \\nthe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . \\ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn\\'t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . \\nto triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there\\'s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . \\none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . \\nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . \\ntom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . \\nhe\\'s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . \\nhe doesn\\'t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . \\nthe mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . \\nthrough a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general\\'s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each\\'s death simultaneously . \\nwhen they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . \\nit\\'s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . \\nbut finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , \" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . \" \\nthe saving of private ryan isn\\'t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . \\nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . \\nwhen miller\\'s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn\\'t so quick to shrug it off . \\nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone\\'s sense of hope a reality . \\nthe mission to find ryan gives miller\\'s group a destination , but not direction . \\nalong the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . \\na few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . \\nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the film\\'s major philosophical metaphors . \\nthe soldiers don\\'t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . \\nunfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn\\'t want us to think these men are invincible .

       " b'if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell\\'s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era\\'s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \\nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \\nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \\nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \\nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers\\'s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \\nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \\nboring . \\nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\\'s lifelessness . \\n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o\\'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \\nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \\nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \\nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers\\' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club\\'s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow\\'s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she\\'s a peripheral character at best ) . \\nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \\nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \\neven whit stillman\\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \\ndancing isn\\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\\'s fault . \\nfrom what i\\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\\'s legend . \\nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \\naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \\nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \\nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \\nthey fail on both counts . \\nultimately , _54_\\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \\nas in , there isn\\'t any to be had for the audience . \\ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \\nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \\nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \\nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \\nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \\nthey\\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \\nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \\nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \\n',\n",
       " b'let\\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \\nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \\nlet\\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \\nnow let\\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\\'s worth . \\nwouldn\\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \\nof course you would . \\nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \\nthat\\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\\'s not for sale . \\nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \\nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \\nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \\nin fact , it is this film\\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \\nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \\nit\\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \\ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \\nthe situation is one we\\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \\nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \\ndarryl thinks he\\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \\nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \" investments \" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \\nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \\nthey\\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \\nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \\nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \\nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \\ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \\ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \\nit\\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \\ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \\nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \\none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \\nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\\'s running time . \\nluckily , it\\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \\nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \\ni\\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \\nand , for that matter , it\\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \\n',\n",

       " b\"the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence . \\nit's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn't make a shred of sense . \\nand whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? \\njames foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor . \\nbut the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train . \\nat least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role . \\nchow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop . \\nhe's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he's very familiar with chinatown . \\nthat's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . \\nnick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life . \\nwhat happens after that is kind of a mystery to me . \\ni'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) . \\ni'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff . \\ni'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way . \\nthere's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main story . \\none of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense . \\ni don't blame this entirely on foley , because he's obviously a good director . \\ni'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act . \\none scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he's angry about his new white partner . \\nhe's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . \\n ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all . ) \\nthere are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent . \\nthere's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . \\nthe plot itself never straightens out . \\ni'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . \\nthe corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . \\nthe sequences aren't bad , but they're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? \\non that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? \\none too many , i'd imagine . \\nfoley's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . \\nthe scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . \\nchow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . \\nwahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he's still fun to watch . \\ni also liked the subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . \\nbut the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes . \\na complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it's over . \\nthe corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there's nothing left to hold on to . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . \\nfrom my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet\\'s film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . \\nfrom my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet\\'s script was actually a masterpiece . \\nthe spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer\\'s complete attention . \\nmiss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . \\nalso like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending . \\nmamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games . \\nlike his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . \\nbecause we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . \\nmamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end . \\nthe power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious . \\nthe spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . \\nafter seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . \\nhis direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . \\nthe story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative \" process \" that everyone is trying to get their hands on . \\nsoon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his \" process . \" \\nthrough his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross\\' boss mr . klein . \\nplayed by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role . \\nthe most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott\\'s joe ross . \\nthe character\\'s transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable . \\ndavid mamet\\'s script is so interesting because we know people don\\'t actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them . \\nhis beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge . \\nthis is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie . \\n',\n",

       " b'mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \\nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it\\'s just about time . \\nfor over twenty-five years , jackie\\'s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \\n \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \\ni\\'m not entirely sure why , exactly . \\nin many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie\\'s other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \\nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \\nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \\nthey\\'re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \\nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \\n \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \\n ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \\na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \\nat the time , i didn\\'t really think it was anything special . . . but \\nafter having seen more films like it , it\\'s kind of grown on me . ) \\n \" drunken master \" \\'s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \\nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \\nafter embarrassing his instructor\\'s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \\nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \\nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \\nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \\nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \\nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \\nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \\nthen , when he\\'s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \\nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \\n \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \\nit\\'s been said before , but i\\'ll say it again--these fights don\\'t just _happen_ , they\\'re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \\nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \\nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \\nwhether jackie wins or loses , it\\'s really something to see . . . and \\nit\\'s often as funny as anything , too . \\nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \\nthere\\'s very little that\\'s new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \\nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \\nbut they\\'re still hilarious as ever . \\nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they\\'re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \\nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \\ni\\'m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \\nit apparently helps if you\\'re drunk while you\\'re doing it . \\ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there\\'s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what\\'s going on . \\ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film\\'s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it\\'s \\nnot just martial arts , it\\'s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \\non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \\n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn\\'t . \\nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you\\'ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \\nit\\'s much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \\nyou might very well like it . \\nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \\n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \\nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \\nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \\nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren\\'t really _too_ bad . . . if \\nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \\ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \\nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \\nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i\\'ve been told to suggest the \" once upon a time in china \" series starring jet li ( though i haven\\'t personally seen any of them yet ) . \\nif you choose to watch \" drunken master \" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that\\'s out there . \\nall in all , i give this film an . \\n',\n",

proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . \\nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . \\nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . \\nhis life seems to be on the rise . \\nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . \\nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . \\nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . \\nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . \\nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . \\nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . \\nafter a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin\\'s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . \\na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin\\'s real father . \\nis it all just a big nightmare ? \\nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin\\'s life ? \\nthe devil\\'s advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don\\'t expect . \\nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? \\nif so , the devil\\'s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . \\ni went into the devil\\'s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . \\ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . \\nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn\\'t like the ending ? ) . \\nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . \\nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . \\nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . \\nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . \\nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . \\nthe film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . \\nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . \\nit was at this point that i felt cheated . \\ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . \\neverything occurs from his perspective . \\nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . \\nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . \\ni don\\'t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . \\nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil\\'s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . \\nit earned its r rating for a reason . \\nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . \\nthis film really isn\\'t subtle about anything , showing us everything . \\nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . \\nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . \\ni don\\'t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . \\nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . \\nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . \\nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann\\'s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . \\nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . \\nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . \\nsomething the devil\\'s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \\nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \\nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \\nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \\nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \\nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \\nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \\nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil\\'s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i\\'m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \\nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \\nthe cast of the devil\\'s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don\\'t expect . \\nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \\nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \\nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \\ni have never seen him more believable to date . \\nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \\nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \\nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \\njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller\\'s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \\njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin\\'s past . \\nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \\none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \\nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \\nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \\nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \\ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \\ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . \\nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . \\npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . \\n',\n",

       " b'after having heard so many critics describe \" return to me \" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \\nwhat made \" return to me \" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \\nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \\nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \\nthe charisma of the two leads ? \\neven now i can\\'t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven\\'t see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \\ni don\\'t think any of the romances i\\'ve seen have been classified as such . \\nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \\nit was traditional , magical . \\nwe knew it couldn\\'t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \\nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn\\'t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \\nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt\\'s direction . \\nfrom the very first bird\\'s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we\\'re in for something sweet . \\nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \\nreal people don\\'t act that way ; real people aren\\'t that nice . \\nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks\\' existence . \\nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt\\'s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \\neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \\n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob\\'s wardrobes . \\nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \\nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \\n \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \\nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we\\'re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \\nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \\ndisappointingly , david alan grier\\'s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \\nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \\ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x-files . \" \\nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \\nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \\nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \\nwhile \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \\nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife\\'s heart . \\nwe already know that there\\'s going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \\nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she\\'s supposed to have his ex-wife\\'s heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \\nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \\nhowever , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won\\'t do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . \\ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \\nit shows . \\nthe bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn\\'t imagined . \\n',\n",
       " b\"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \\ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \\nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \\ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \\nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \\nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \\nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \\nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \\nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \\nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \\nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \\nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \\ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \\nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \\nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \\non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \\none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \\nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \\nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \\nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \\nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \\njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \\nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \\nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \\ntarzan continues this trend . \\nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \\nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \\ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \\nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \\nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \\nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \\nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \\nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \\nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \\nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \\nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \\nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \\n\",\n",

one should start each day considering oneself as dead . \\nliving atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . \\nhe craves nothing more . \\nas he puts it late in the film , \" i\\'ve seen all i want to see . \" \\nhe exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . \\nghost dog wasn\\'t always as he is presented . \\nin several roshomon-like flashbacks , it\\'s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that \" samaritan \" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . \\nghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . \\nafter years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill \" handsome frank \" , a made man within louie\\'s organization who has run away with the crime boss\\'s daughter , louise ( vessey ) . \\nghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . \\nin a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . \\nupset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . \\nthe rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . \\nthe theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog\\'s world . \\neach time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it\\'s from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . \\nnear the end , louise is watching a cartoon that\\'s a departure from the previously shown ones . \\nit\\'s a bit of audacity on jarmusch\\'s part that is nicely effective , despite it\\'s surrealistic nature . \\nas ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . \\none is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . \\nshe comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . \\nby film\\'s end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . \\nthe other person in ghost dog\\'s world is an ice cream ( de bankole\\' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . \\nthe vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . \\njarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . \\nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . \\n ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost\\'s dog\\'s sense of honor . ) \\nthe head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . \\nof all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . \\ngorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . \\nruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . \\nhe is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . \\nwhitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor\\'s use , his face . \\nghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . \\nthe fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . \\nalthough the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . \\ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . \\nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . \\ncarried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity . \\n',\n",

       " b\"no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . \\nevent horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . \\nit is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . \\nthe magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . \\nthe story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . \\nthe event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . \\nthe ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . \\na search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . \\nthe designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . \\nevent horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . \\nwhile in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . \\nthe story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! \\ni can't stand this anymore ! ' . \\nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . \\nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . \\neven so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . \\ndirector paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . \\nthis picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . \\nalthough on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . \\nhowever , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . \\nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . \\ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . \\nbe forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . \\nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! \\nevent horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! \\nit has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . \\nnow the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel . \\nthe fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either . \\nfast forward to the late '80's . \\nsteve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) . \\nnor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role . \\nthat is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter . \\nthe other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original . \\nthe only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets . \\nit looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets . \\nthe special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original's . \\nunlike the original , they don't look campy , they just look cheap . \\none bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith . \\nshe is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . \\nin terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky . \\nseems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite . \\nanyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans . \\nthe more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets . \\nand it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either . \\nanyway , it attacks this little town and it's up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it . \\nnot really , but that is how it seems . \\nthis version attempts to recapture the camp of the original . \\nas i've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy . \\nin the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness . \\nalthough , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon . \\nthe reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . \\nalthough some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . \\nit also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible . \\nsadly , it doesn't work very well . \\nif you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original . \\n ( although that isn't so hot either . ) \\nthis newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today\\x12s movies or novels , you must \\x13suspend disbelief . \\x14 \\nhowever , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . \\nit came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . \\neven if you can ignore these somewhat \\x13white\\x14 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain\\x12s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don\\x12t gel . \\nfirstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . \\nhe _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . \\nas a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . \\ni say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . \\nbut nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . \\nwith a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn\\x12t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . \\njim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . \\nbut of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . \\nthe local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . \\ndirector mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \\x13goodies versus baddies , \\x14 there are numerous twists in it\\x12s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . \\nbut by the time these interesting changes occur , it\\x12s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . \\nhard rain\\x12s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it\\x12s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . \\nnot at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . \\nsuch titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . \\nstrangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . \\nwe can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . \\nif you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . \\ni now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don\\x12t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . \\nalthough hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . \\nthe addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can\\x12t handle anything else . \\ndespite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . \\nno creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesn\\x12t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"disconnect the phone line . \\ndon't accept the charges . \\ndo anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' . \\ni figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so . \\nthe film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . \\nmeg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease . \\nwhile this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . \\n`hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests . \\nfor the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . \\nthis is an annoying and ineffective device . \\ncell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems . \\nif `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . \\ngranted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . \\nbut they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . \\nthe most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . \\nwe are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . \\ngeorgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . . \\n`georgia' . \\nmaddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog . \\nryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' . \\nkudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted . \\nditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . \\nher frenzy is apparent . \\nfor a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . \\nthe reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . \\neven so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . \\nthat about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . \\nmy curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour . \\nbut really , it's no mystery . \\nthe predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses . \\npin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations . \\nit's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable . \\nuh-uh . \\nit's a wrong number from the beginning . \\n\",\n",

\\nno ? well , how about sharon stone ? \\nthought so ) . \\nif anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven\\'t seen that many films . \\nthere is no suspense here . \\ntrust me , i looked hard to find some . \\ni had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations . \\nfincher aim\\'s for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas . \\nthere are those that might say \" the game \" is not intended to be viewed literally . \\ni would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film . \\nthe film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues . \\nthere is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who\\'s in on the whole thing . \\nhe is charged by his paranoia . \\nhe is looking at the world through new eyes . \\nit is the last thought-provoking moment in the film . \\nfrom there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us . \\nany significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device . \\nat the outset , we\\'re told each \" game \" is tailored to the individual . \\nultimately , this \" game \" is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul . \\nyet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we\\'re given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is . \\ni wanted to like this film more than i did . \\ni look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized . \\ni can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn\\'t mean we were seeing what was really happening . \\nbryan singer\\'s \" the usual suspects \" for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas . \\nalso , there is the underrated \" jacob\\'s ladder , \" with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism . \\nhere are two examples of films that don\\'t simply manipulate for manipulations\\' sake . \\nthere are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place . \\none major issue that comes up in \" the game \" is whether or not the whole \" illusion \" is just a highly sophisticated con game . \\nwell , i can tell you right now , after you\\'ve spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing . \\n',\n",

       " b'historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . \\nfor many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . \\nbut in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . \\nand , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \" . \\nthe name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . \\nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . \\nin his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . \\nalthough english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn\\'t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . \\nmurron\\'s death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . \\nthrough time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace\\'s rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . \\nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn\\'t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . \\nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn\\'t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . \\nhowever , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . \\nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . \\nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . \\nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven\\'s ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . \\ncompared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . \\nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . \\nwhat makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist . \\nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . \\nwallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . \\nnaturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . \\nhowever , even those who don\\'t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . \\nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren\\'t as effective as they should be . \\nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . \\nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . \\nbrendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman\\'s general ) is also very good as wallace\\'s trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . \\ndavid o\\'harra is very entertaining as wallace\\'s irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . \\nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . \\ncatherine mccormack as wallace\\'s wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . \\nfrom the technical point of view , the film is also very good . \\nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . \\non the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . \\nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . \\nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" \\'s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . \\nhe is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain\\'s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood . \\nto make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives\\' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . \\nhowever , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . \\naccording to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . \\nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \\nin the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . \\n',\n",
       " b'after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash . \\nmaybe not ! \\nmindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether . \\ntango & cash has \" lowest common denominator \" written all over it . \\nthe movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts . \\nstallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn\\'t need the money . \\nin an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits . \\nthe two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names . \\ntango & cash is unbearably noisy . \\nfor starters , there\\'s harold faltermeyer\\'s annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes . \\nto make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier . \\nin fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases . \\nthere\\'s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie . \\nscreenwriter randy feldman\\'s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv . \\nhis shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone\\'s efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual . \\nin a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier . \\nit\\'s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman\\'s script and thinking , \" i want to be in this movie . \" \\nthe film\\'s plot doesn\\'t have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting . \\nfeldman\\'s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable . \\nthey simply could have called it \" action movie . \" \\nevery character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . \\nadding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a \" road runner \" cartoon . \\naction movies don\\'t have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you\\'re not thinking about the lack of realism . \\nthe only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . \\nthere are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires . \\nthe film\\'s main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell . \\nunfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . \\nthe dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing . \\nit\\'s a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming \" lethal weaponesque \" adventure . \\ntango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . \\nseeing russell in drag is the movie\\'s funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . \\nfurthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence . \\nmachine guns and torture generally don\\'t mix well with comedy . \\njack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain . \\nhis character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice . \\nlike many movie villains , palance likes to play games . \\nin fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room . \\nyou have to wonder why palance doesn\\'t just shoot the detectives in the head ! \\nthe story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent . \\nteri hatcher plays stallone\\'s sister and russell\\'s love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be . \\nbut regrettably , hatcher\\'s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty . \\nevery time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination . \\nthere\\'s really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film . \\nand , more to the point , tango definitely isn\\'t worth a penny of your cash--so don\\'t bother . \\n',\n",

       " b'i didn\\'t come into city of angels expecting greatness . \\ni\\'ve never seen wim wenders\\' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based . \\nthen again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold . \\nunfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them . \\nthe plot , for those that couldn\\'t tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) . \\nof course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye . \\ntheir love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human . \\nusing this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection . \\nthe first half of the movie succeeds on most points . \\ncage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn\\'t know feelings so can\\'t really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions . \\nunfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive . \\nas maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right . \\nher beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning . \\nlikewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film . \\nwhen the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel . \\nthe beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel . \\nthe film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie . \\nthe grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel\\'s eyes . \\nthe movie devolves into an examination of how seth can\\'t feel the world or , more importantly , he can\\'t feel maggie : he can\\'t smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats . \\nthis change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth\\'s intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears . \\nif he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn\\'t her just make the leap and become human ? \\nafter all , what\\'s so great about being an angel ? \\nsure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what\\'s that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ? \\nand from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it\\'s all downhill . \\nthe philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience\\'s hankie . \\nit\\'s the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film . \\ni feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level . \\ni came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing . \\ni could go on longer , but i don\\'t want to \" ruin \" the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on . \\ncity of angels , then , is a paradox . \\nit\\'s a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea . \\nall these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up . \\n',\n",

       " b\"it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . \\na poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . \\nin directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . \\nin addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . \\nthe two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . \\njackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . \\nthe other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one . \\nchan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time . \\nchris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance . \\nhe works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . \\nalmost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . \\nwe're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . \\ncut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . \\nthe fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . \\nthe fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . \\nit's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . \\nrattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank . \\nthere are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . \\nalso , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . \\nhowever , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background . \\nalmost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it's tucker's toned-down routine or chan's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . \\na recommendable visit to the theater , indeed . \\n\",\n",

       " b'vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . \\nand , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) . \\nbut lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre . \\nand remind us he does in his latest film , vampires . \\nthere was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema\\'s immensely successful blade , released in august . \\nthe two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don\\'t even agree on some basic points of the slaying method . \\n ( for instance , blade\\'s main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow\\'s technique is a wooden stake to the heart . ) \\nblade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate . \\nboth have their advantages , and here , carpenter\\'s style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered . \\nwhen it\\'s all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum . \\nthis time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) . \\nhe\\'s a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch . \\nhe and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a \" master \" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \\nvalek kills all of jack\\'s team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old . \\napparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime . \\nso with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation . \\nthe script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year . \\ncrow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism . \\nbaldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith\\'s bad guy . \\ngriffith\\'s intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he\\'s got to talk sometime . \\nluckily , he\\'s got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance . \\nall said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one . \\ncertainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" america\\'s sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn\\'t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . \\nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . \\ncrystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \\n \" america\\'s sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . \\nit\\'s a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . \\nby the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . \\njohn cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . \\nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . \\nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen\\'s solo films have tanked . \\nto make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber\\'s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . \\ndesperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . \\nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . \\nhe enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen\\'s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . \\nwhat lee doesn\\'t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . \\npress junkets are a haven for control freaks . \\nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . \\ngenerally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . \\nthe next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . \\nevery 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . \\nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . \\nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . \\nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . \\nthe \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . \\nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . \\nthe junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . \\nfor most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . \\nwhen they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de-clawed . \\ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . \\nlee certainly isn\\'t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . \\nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? \\nhell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . \\nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn\\'t matter because any publicity is good publicity . \\nand thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . \\nso what about the cast ? \\njulia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . \\ncatherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . \\nby casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on \" comic relief \" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . \\nin supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed \" too broad . \" \\nseth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . \\ncome to think of it , \" little to work with \" is the operative phrase for this movie . \\nas a hollywood satire , \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is toothless . \\nas a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . \\nsuch a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . \\nhad it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been \" much ado about nothing . \" \\n',\n",

       " b'john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . \\nso effortlessly that people tend to forget he\\'s there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor\\'s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . \\nexample : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn\\'t be more divergent--- i\\'ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! \\nwas a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn\\'t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . \\ni muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . \\nshe responded with her usual query , \" whose in that one ? \" \\nthis is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . \\nif the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . \\nanyway , when i answered \" john cusack \" , she replied with a rather stunned \" who ? \" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . \\nnow i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it\\'s understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . \\ni showed her a picture of cusack\\'s mug in the paper hoping for an \" oh - him , yes he\\'s quite good \" instead i got a \" no - i don\\'t know him \" . \\nat this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack\\'s relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . \\ncu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . \\ni\\'m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as \" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) \" . \\nhe\\'s not a brand name , and his movies usually aren\\'t big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he\\'s kind of a genius . \\nwith his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90\\'s . \\nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . \\ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he\\'s a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . \\nand he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin\\'s and val kilmer\\'s seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . \\nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it\\'s a hit . \\nit was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . \\nit\\'s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . \\nhigh fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his \" top 5 break ups list \" . \\nthis is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller\\'s day off . \\nat first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack\\'s witty delivery . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy we don\\'t mind talking directly to us . \\ngradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it\\'s all very existential ) . \\nthough that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . \\nthe best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis\\' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy i\\'m sure we\\'ve all met before , a blowhard who thinks he\\'s always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others . \\nbut i like this guy , because of how black plays him . \\nthe actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) . \\nhe\\'s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . \\n ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . \\nbut fears and black never let that happen . \\nthe character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . \\nhe\\'s over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own \" charm \" . \\ntim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . \\nthe one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . \\ni give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it\\'s hard to see why cusack\\'s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . \\nthis reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those \" special people \" whose wheels turn a little slower ) . \\nin fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i\\'d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . \\nhigh fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . \\nfears\\' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i\\'m beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i\\'ll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . \\nbut cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . \\ni\\'m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . \\nhis character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . \\n',\n",
       " b\"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . \\nyou kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . \\nas it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes . \\ninstead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . \\nthe laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . \\nthe film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . \\nhe loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . \\narthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . \\nhis personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . \\nin fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . \\nit's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . \\narthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . \\nshe has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . \\nveteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . \\nshe plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . \\narthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . \\narthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . \\njoey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . \\narthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! \\nhe finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations . \\nthe various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . \\nlike wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . \\nevery character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . \\nthe movie also offers a provocative look at technology . \\nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . \\nthe film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . \\nwang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . \\nwas einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? \\nis arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? \\nthe movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . \\naccording to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . \\nironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . \\nwang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . \\ngriffith . \\ncinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . \\nmason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . \\nthe laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault . \\nwang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all . \\nfor instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems . \\nin weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . \\noverall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . \\non the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . \\nthe heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . \\nyou can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . \\ni spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . \\nthis was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . \\nthen marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . \\nit certainly didn\\'t look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his \" last night of freedom . \" \\nben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this \\'till death do you part business . \\nthen , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . \\nas transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he\\'s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she\\'s never had . \\nforces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . \\nben is an ideal role for affleck\\'s easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . \\nsandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . \\nthe two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script\\'s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . \\nlively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . \\nthe kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . \\nforces of nature isn\\'t about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it\\'s about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it\\'s not what he thought it was . \\nlawrence\\'s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . \\nearlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . \\nthough one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you\\'ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . \\nthat is , provided you\\'re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . \\nfor a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . \\noccasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can\\'t find what\\'s underneath . \\na script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes\\' excesses can\\'t spoil this unique concoction . \\nforces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . \\n',\n",

\\nyes . \\ndoes it matter ? \\nnot really . \\nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \\nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \\nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \\na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \\'69 and that john has found in the present day . \\nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \\nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \\nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \\nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \\nthis isn\\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \\nwhen frank doesn\\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \\nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \\nsometimes frank\\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \\nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\\'t really the point . \\nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it\\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \\nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \\nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \\ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \\ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \\nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \\n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \\ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \\nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\\'s face it : it\\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \\nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \\nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \\nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \\nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \\nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \\nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\\'t believe in the characters , we don\\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \\nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \\ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \\nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \\nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \\nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \\nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \\nperhaps the only thing i didn\\'t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \\nbut that\\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \\ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \\nwho wouldn\\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \\nor see how their children turn out ? \\n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \\nand don\\'t call me a sissy . \\n',\n",

       " b'countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally . \\nluckily , movie reviewers aren\\'t burdened with such legislation . \\notherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer . \\nin case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans . \\nin any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times . \\nthose who don\\'t usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery . \\nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film . \\nlike so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since . \\nperhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away . \\nor perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before . \\nanyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life . \\nand it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas\\' epic . \\nstar wars wasn\\'t just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) . \\nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema . \\nuntil than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood\\'s financial and technical resources to create serious , \" personal \" or \" artsy \" movies . \\nas a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn\\'t want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen . \\ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue . \\nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . \\nserious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of \" blockbuster \" philosophy . \\none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre . \\nuntil 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain . \\nin late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn\\'t look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey . \\nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies . \\nhowever , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn\\'t like it . \\nas a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s . \\nafter that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment . \\nironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of \" new hollywood \" generation of young movie authors who made \" artsy \" and \" personal \" films in early 1970s . \\ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti . \\nboth movies were considered \" personal \" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular . \\nin a sense , star wars is an also very \" personal \" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it . \\nbut unlike many \" personal \" movies of the era , its \" personality \" was in line with the wishes of the general audience . \\nthe plot , set \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away \" , begins in a time of civil war . \\nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic . \\nin order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets . \\nthe information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser . \\nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) . \\nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot . \\nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) . \\nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force . \\nafter some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force . \\ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) . \\ncritics who don\\'t like the movie , especially those who can\\'t forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of \" new hollywood \" , are prone to point the lack of originality . \\non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa\\'s samurai classic the hidden fortress . \\non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . \\nthe others would find the author\\'s element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . \\neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . \\ngeorge lucas\\' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . \\ncharacters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . \\nwe have a \" coming-of-age \" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . \\nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . \\nunfortunately , the same can\\'t be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . \\nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . \\noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas\\' superiority over kubrick . \\nhowever , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren\\'t the most remembered trademark of the movie . \\nthat honour should definitely go to the \" oscar \" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . \\nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . \\nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas\\' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture . \\n',\n",

       " b'there is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \\nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \\nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \\nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \\nit is an important scene for several reasons . \\nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \\nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \\nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \\nthe angels here are stark and believable . \\nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \\nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \\nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \\nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \\n \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \\nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \\nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \\nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\\'s not enough . \\nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \\nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \\nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \\nblue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \\nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \\nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \\n \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\\'s haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \\nwenders\\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \\nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \\nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\\'t suffer extensive damage . \\nthis may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \\nand yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \\nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \\nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \\nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \\nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \\nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \\ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \\nwhat is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \\nit\\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \\nit doesn\\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \\ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \\n____________________________________________ visit \" charlie don\\'t surf ! \" \\nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : //www . bigfoot . com/~jimkendrick \\n|| e-mail : jimkendrick@bigfoot . com \\n',\n",

       " b'capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \\nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver\\'s travels and treat it as an action film . \\nthat makes it a film without much center . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \\nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver\\'s travels . \\nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift\\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \\nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \\nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \\nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \\nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\\'s best if not his best . \\nwhen the film\\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\\'s new version is even less faithful . \\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \\nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world\\'s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \\nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \\n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \\nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \\nand the language they talk is earth- english . \\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \\nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \\nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn\\'t like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\\'s visualization is really an improvement . \\nthese visuals work nicely . \\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \\napes spring incredible distances . \\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \\nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \\nbut he delivers them very well . \\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \\nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \\nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\\'s performance in spartacus . \\nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \\ndanny elfman\\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \\ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n",
       " b'ladies and gentlemen , 1997\\'s independence day is here ! \\nit\\'s title : starship troopers . \\nand surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . \\ni realize that i gave last year\\'s sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . \\nafter subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn\\'t as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . \\nstarship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . \\nas a result , starship troopers is a

kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . \\nwhile starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : \" the \\'star wars\\' of the 90s . \" \\nam i being to generous to this film ? \\nperhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . \\nin essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . \\nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . \\nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a \" kick-the-aliens\\'-asses \" style . \\nid4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . \\nthis new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . \\nthe alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . \\nhowever , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . \\nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . \\nmore than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . \\nand they should be . \\ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . \\nthis is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . \\nit is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . \\nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . \\nmixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . \\nstating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , \\nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . \\nhowever , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . \\nafter witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . \\nwe are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . \\nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . \\nhowever , carmen isn\\'t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . \\nhowever , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . \\nunfortunately , rico isn\\'t interested in dizzy . \\nthis setup is rather cliched , as is the result of

unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . \\nfollowing the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . \\nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . \\nmany dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs\\' attacks . \\na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . \\nthe troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . \\ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . \\nit\\'s about special effects and gory violence . \\ndirector verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . \\nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . \\nstarship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year\\'s event horizon . \\nthe r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . \\nmy guess is that verhoeven\\'s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . \\nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . \\ndespite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . \\nwhile watching the film , we never second guess the character\\'s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \\nthankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \\nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . \\ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . \\nto most guys , he will come across as artificial . \\nfortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . \\ndina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . \\nher dizzy is extremely likeable . \\ndenise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . \\njake busey , gary busey\\'s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . \\nneil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . \\nhowever , he does give a good performance . \\nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . \\nhis performance rises above the rest . \\nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside\\'s presence on screen . \\nunfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . \\ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film . \\nhis direction is fast and unrelentless . \\nhe never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . \\nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . \\nthe writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . \\nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart . \\nwe aren\\'t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . \\nthankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don\\'t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . \\namazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . \\nin fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . \\nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . \\ni haven\\'t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . \\noh , and the special effects are first rate . \\nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . \\nbelieve me when i say this : don\\'t take young kids to see this film . \\nit is extremely violent . \\nin fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . \\nhowever , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . \\nit\\'s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . \\nand still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . \\nnow that would be entertaining ! \\n',\n",
       " b'i\\'m an avid fan of the \" alien \" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . \\nof course , that doesn\\'t mean that i\\'m gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because \" alien : resurrection , \" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . \\nhowever , it\\'s a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . \\nin short , i had a good time . \\n \" alien : resurrection \" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre\\'s answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . \\nof course , the last one wasn\\'t very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn\\'t financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . \\nso back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that\\'s a bad thing , but it\\'s becoming a cliche ) . \\nso she\\'s cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called \" the auriga \" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . \\nonce you get past the fact that you can\\'t figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film\\'s okay . \\nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won\\'t state it , but unless you\\'ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it\\'s nicely covered up ) . \\nthere\\'s a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it\\'s never really deepened enough . \\noh well . \\nwell , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . \\nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who\\'s death is comical yet sad since , well , he\\'s dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . \\nof course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old \" alien \" -brand fun . \\nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there\\'s always a bit of it , most notably in \" aliens \" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . \\nwhat\\'s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \\n \" alien \" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \\n \" aliens \" is a wild , tense thriller . \\n \" alien 3 \" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . \\n \" alien 4 \" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . \\njean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like \" das boot \" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . \\nthe chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there\\'s the most tense surgery scene since \" face/off \" towards the beginning ) . \\nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . \\nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . \\nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . \\none is the aforementioned surgery scene . \\nanother one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . \\nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet\\'s earlier film , \" delicatessen \" ) . \\nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to \" goldfinger \" ) . \\nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i\\'m sure i\\'m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . \\nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \\nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \\nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there\\'s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \\nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" \\njohner : \" well , i can get you off . \\nbut not this ship . \" ) \\nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \\nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \\nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \\nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \\nshe\\'s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she\\'s just awesome . \\noverall , it\\'s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn\\'t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \\nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn\\'t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \\nbut it\\'s entertaining as hell , and it\\'s definitely fit for the \" alien \" series . \\n',\n",

       " b'set in the late 80\\'s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie \" genre \" that ellis helped to create . \\nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . \\nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . \\nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . \\ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . \\ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . \\nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn\\'t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . \\ni picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . \\nthe movie has a similar effect , but at least it\\'s less cryptic than ellis\\' novel . \\nfor once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . \\nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . \\nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman\\'s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . \\nas a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . \\nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith\\'s catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . \\nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . \\nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . \\nthankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . \\nside note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman\\'s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she\\'s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . \\nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . \\nit\\'s a subtle in-joke and it\\'s one i found to be pretty humorous . \\ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . \\nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . \\nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . \\ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . \\nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he\\'s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . \\none sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news\\' song \" hip to be square \" right before burying an axe in a co-worker\\'s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . \\nside note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis\\' \" hip to be square \" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don\\'t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . \\nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of \" stuck in the middle with you \" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . \\ni\\'m assuming that collins requested the same . \\non a similar note , whitney houston\\'s cover of \" the greatest love of all \" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn\\'t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . \\napparently , houston wasn\\'t as open about the use of her song as the others were . \\na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film\\'s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . \\ndon\\'t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . \\nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i\\'m still undecided . \\nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . \\nthe scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . \\ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . \\nother than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman\\'s reality ) . \\ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . \\nit may not change anyone\\'s life , but it will certainly have an effect . \\ni know i will certainly hear \" hip to be square \" in a different context the next time i hear it . \\n[r]

\\nwell , just about as good as baldwin\\'s steven seagal impression ( for those i\\'ve confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . \\nnow let me clarify , i don\\'t love just any cop movie ; i\\'m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80\\'s and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . \\ni\\'m partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . \\nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a \" true \" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . \\nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? \\ntruth is i\\'m a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . \\nyes it\\'s all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i\\'m guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . \\nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe\\'s , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . \\nas an adult my tastes haven\\'t changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a \" guy \" film could potentially bring . \\nnow what if it\\'s the cops who\\'re the corrupt ones ? \\nooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . \\nthrow a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) \\ninto the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . \\nhow absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? \\nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . \\nthe film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . \\nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn\\'t . \\n ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . \\nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn\\'t make it to where he should have . \\n ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . \\nhere , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino\\'s in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . \\nwilliams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . \\nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . \\nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . \\nthe squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . \\ndanny has done this , and though he\\'s a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . \\nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a \" double agent \" . \\nhe does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . \\nright away we know that that is exactly what he\\'ll have to do . \\nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . \\nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . \\nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? \\nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . \\nlumet\\'s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . \\nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . \\nlumet\\'s worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . \\nthis isn\\'t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet\\'s most recent cop \\\\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . \\nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . \\nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . \\nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . \\nof course cop movies aren\\'t popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn\\'t gay , the lame comic relief character who\\'s never funny , and on and on . \\nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\\\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . \\nit focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . \\nthere\\'s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he\\'s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . \\nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . \\nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . \\nhe\\'s lost his voice . \\ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter ? \\nmaybe not to most , but it sure made my night . \\nand in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it\\'s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things . \\n',\n",

       " b'often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray . \\nmany elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don\\'t convert into a solid work . \\nalthough a setting is never established , it becomes apparent . \\nthe film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . \\nthe community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last . \\nover time , the people have taken to themselves . \\nthe town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger . \\nso what happens when a \" tourist \" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? \\nhe sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock . \\nit is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby . \\nwhen he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years . \\nit is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages . \\nthe woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town\\'s police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance\\'s involvement with this musician . \\nthe rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray . \\nit features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk . \\ntechnically , this film is a nightmare . \\nthe music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt . \\nthe lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases . \\nthis translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words . \\nin addition , the pace of the film seems uneven . \\nit opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one\\'s patience . \\nthe film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark . \\nthere was , however , potential for this film . \\nit is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re-unification of people . \\nthese are all topics that could easily fill a movie . \\nperhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end . \\nmost importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren\\'t such a bore . \\nuntil then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out \" mommy \" while he wanders astray in a park . \\n',\n",

       " b'with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \\nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \\nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \\nit\\'s also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \\nwhile it\\'s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \\nbut the way we\\'re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \\nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \\nit doesn\\'t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it\\'s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \\nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \\nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \\nit\\'s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \\nit\\'s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \\nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \\nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \\nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \\nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \\neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , \" and he\\'s gay . \" \\nthe town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . \\nthe thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . \\nnaturally the questions pour from howard\\'s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school\\'s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . \\nthe frenzy isn\\'t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and \" entertainment tonight \" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . \\none particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of \" inside entertainment \" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . \\nthe intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . \\nit seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . \\nthe dominoes begin to tumble as howard\\'s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . \\nit all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren\\'t presented with near-perfection by one of this year\\'s most delightful ensemble casts . \\nkline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . \\nthe great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . \\nevery single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . \\ndillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they\\'re up to bat . \\nrudnick\\'s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you\\'ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . \\nwhile in & out doesn\\'t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . \\nthe script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we\\'re allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . \\nit remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we\\'re still allowed a sappily touching ending . \\ndespite it\\'s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . \\nfrank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick\\'s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . \\ncheck this one out . \\nyou\\'ll have a gay old time . \\n',\n",

its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \\nand with good reason . \\nthis is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \\nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \\n ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \\numa thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \\nunfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \\nat this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \\nthe duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \\nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \\nif nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \\nthe story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \\n ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \\noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \\nthe avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \\nmr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \\nat least it all looks good . \\nthis is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \\nin particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \\nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \\nby the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \\nnot coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \\nit's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \\na crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \\nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \\n\",\n",

       " b'robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style . \\nthe film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city\\'s police force . \\n1991\\'s detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike . \\nto make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city . \\non murphy\\'s first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one . \\n ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . ) \\nafter the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i . \\nrecruits his remains for their new \" robocop \" program . \\nusing the remains of murphy\\'s body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal . \\nthe cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i . \\nengineers have erased murphy\\'s memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) . \\nwith his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i . \\nenvisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit\\'s problems . \\nthe remainder of the plot follows robocop\\'s crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers . \\nas a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective . \\ndutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects . \\nseveral sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics . \\nbecause robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater . \\nalthough the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre . \\nrather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society . \\nthe movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors . \\nthese news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore . \\nthe satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood . \\n1990\\'s america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society . \\nthe humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd . \\nverhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary . \\nunfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre . \\nthe movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens . \\nrobocop\\'s main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy\\'s character . \\nwe never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot . \\ndoes murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ? \\nthe script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action . \\nmoreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine . \\nrobocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends . \\nas you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before . \\nin many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish . \\nhowever , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off . \\n',\n",

these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . \\nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . \\nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . \\nwe\\'re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . \\nmatt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . \\ned norton\\'s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they\\'re worth . \\njohn turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . \\nhe\\'s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro\\'s low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich\\'s heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . \\nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike\\'s law professors , abe petrovsky . \\nwhile landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one\\'s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . \\nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn\\'t seem to have much presence on screen . \\nshe\\'s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn\\'t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon\\'s reactions instead . \\na good thing about rounders is that it doesn\\'t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can\\'t find time for humor . \\nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . \\none game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \\n \" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , \" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . \\ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . \\nwith all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . \\nyou might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . \\nluckily , we\\'re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what\\'s going on . \\nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . \\nit\\'s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . \\nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . \\nwait ! \\nas a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . \\nhang on ! \\npacked with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . \\nokay , i guess that\\'s enough . \\noh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol\\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein\\'s mother . \\n',\n",

       " b'talk about beating a dead horse ! \\nwhen home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . \\nthe unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . \\nfor john hughes , two home alone movies weren\\'t enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby\\'s day out , last year\\'s live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year\\'s flubber . \\nnow , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the \" home alone \" name as well . \\nthe result ? 1997\\'s worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 . \\nby changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest . \\nthe new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . \\nhe\\'s not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . \\nthe villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber . \\nin home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . \\nthis time , the kid isn\\'t left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip . \\ninstead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can\\'t go to school . \\nhis dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he\\'s all by himself during the day . \\nthrough a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession . \\nit\\'s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex\\'s home to retrieve it . \\nthe eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains . \\nthe movie\\'s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable . \\npreviously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . \\nthese are far worse . \\nin fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . \\nif it\\'s a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can\\'t home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and \\'90s technology at its disposal ? \\nthere has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children . \\nhome alone 3 will add fuel to the fire . \\nit\\'s one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . \\nadults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? \\nthe level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex\\'s schemes are nasty enough to kill . \\nbut , because this is a \" family film , \" no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell . \\nnot only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it\\'s offensive . \\nit\\'s an exercise in tediousness , and there isn\\'t a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven\\'t seen this stuff before ) . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . \\nmaybe that\\'s why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years . \\n',\n",
       " b'i\\'m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i\\'m guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft . \\nseriously , this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off . \\nthe first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue . \\nan example : \" that [car crash] must\\'ve been awful . . . for \\neveryone involved . \" \\nyou can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said , just no one figured out what . \\ni know in slasher movies there isn\\'t supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don\\'t mind cardboard cutouts , but please don\\'t let the cutouts be so damn bland . \\none reason movies like scream , star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters . \\naside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who aren\\'t on the screen long enough ) no one in urban legend makes the grade . \\nalicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill , rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive ( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film ) and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot . \\ngood thing brad dourif is here , but wait . . . he\\'s only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he\\'s just redoing his good-natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest . \\nwhich brings me to another aspect of urban legend : it\\'s unoriginality . \\nthe film most blatantly ripped off is scream ( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven\\'s and williamson\\'s great success ) . \\nurban legend tries to deconstruct modern-day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films , but it doesn\\'t quite succeed . \\nit\\'s best stab at self-reflexivity is poking fun at \" that girl in the noxzeema ad \" ( ie , rebecca gayheart ) we also have another killer-taunting-his-victim-on-the-phone routine in urban legend and quick , what movie is this exchange of dialogue from : \\nfemale protagonist : why ? \\nvillain : why ? \\nwhy ? ! ? \\ncongratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend . \\nlike i said , this movie could\\'ve been great . \\nif only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script . \\nstill , at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer . \\n',\n",
       " b'synopsis : it\\'s 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york . \\ndisco music is popular , and the sexual revolution is on , but the people of new york are not happy . \\nin fact , they\\'re terrified . \\nas in spike lee\\'s do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip , and peoples\\' tempers are flaring . \\nthe cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam . \\nno one knows who the son of sam is , and no one is safe . \\nall around new york people are different . \\naside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals . \\nin the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny ( john leguizamo ) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna ( mira sorvino ) . \\nvinny\\'s friend ritchie ( adrien brody ) hates disco , works at a gay strip club and doesn\\'t want any of the neighborhood folks to know . \\nritchie\\'s girl ruby ( jennifer esposito ) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut . \\neveryone\\'s different , but nobody in the film wants to be framed as \" alien \" to the community . \\nunfortunately , the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor . \\nopinion : director spike lee\\'s summer of sam is not about a psycho killer . \\nnor is it about cops trying to apprehend him . \\nit\\'s about differences and how , given the right conditions , even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion . \\none thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex . \\nin other movies sex is glamorized . \\nfor example , james bond gets a sexual reward for winning . \\nor boring made-for-video \" suspense \" movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake . \\nand every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess . \\nnot so with summer of sam . \\nin a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy . \\nsex is there , but it isn\\'t gratuitous or titillating . \\nin fact , some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed . \\nsex is in the film because ( sexual ) deviance is part of the film\\'s major theme of \" difference \" breeding hostility . \\nin my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999 , as rare and thought-provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking . \\n',\n",
       " b\"at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . \\nbasically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . \\nhow ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . \\nswordfish is loud , violent and amoral . \\nit has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . \\nand how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? \\nby robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . \\nswordfish is a very cynical movie . \\nit relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . \\nthe movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . \\nthis is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . \\nthe storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . \\ntalk about whacked-out patriotism . \\nmy objections to swordfish are many . \\nthe body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . \\nit's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . \\nanother example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . \\nstanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . \\naudience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . \\nthus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . \\nin fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . \\nthen there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . \\nchildren as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . \\nthere is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . \\nyea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it . \\ntravolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . \\nhis character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . \\njackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . \\nhis only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . \\nhis sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . \\nhalle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . \\nswordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . \\nviewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . \\nand maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . \\nand that is not enough . \\nthis is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water . \\n\",\n",
       " b'robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style . \\noverwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . \\nso when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it\\'s in trouble . \\njakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically \" uplifting \" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn\\'t realize it . \\nwilliams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . \\none night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment . \\njakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . \\nthe announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant \" heil hitler ! \" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob\\'s ghetto . \\nliberation ! he thinks . \\nthe next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along . \\nsoon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death . \\nthis is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate . \\nthe danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger . \\nin a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home . \\napparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear . \\nhe and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning . \\nthe moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine . \\nbut jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false . \\nsuch hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren\\'t met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope . \\nthat\\'s the film\\'s biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false . \\nit\\'s never moving because it doesn\\'t give us anything to be moved by . \\njakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing . \\nrobin williams doesn\\'t inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent . \\nhe is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless . \\nnot since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn\\'t the robin williams we know and love . \\nin good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it . \\nhere , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor . \\njakob the liar will be compared with last year\\'s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a \" holocaust comedy \" . \\nit\\'s not a comedy . \\nit tries , sometimes , but it rarely works . \\nis it a melodrama ? \\na war movie ? \\na character study ? \\nno , no , and no . \\njakob the liar is the kind of movie that can\\'t be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \\nthat\\'s right . \\nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \\nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \\nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \\nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \\nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \\ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon\\'s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \\nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he\\'s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \\nit\\'s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn\\'t playing like he\\'s autistic . \\nunlike dustin hoffman\\'s performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio\\'s in \" what\\'s eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \\nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character\\'s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \\nhell , he doesn\\'t even have to be shy . \\nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis\\' arm . \\nwillis\\' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \\nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon\\'s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \\nof course , we know that isn\\'t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \\nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \\njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \\nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon\\'s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \\nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \\nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \\ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey\\'s character is far too accommodating . \\nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o\\'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \\nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \\nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn\\'t rise to the challenge . \\nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \\nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it\\'s more suspenseful that way . \\ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \\nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \\nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \\nmaybe the book was better , but the way it\\'s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \\n',\n",
       " b'more than forty years ago , the \" sword and sandals \" genre of historical epic ruled the box office . \\nduring the 1950\\'s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . \\n \" ben-hur . \" \\n \" cleopatra . \" \\n \" the robe . \" \\n \" sparticus . \" \\n \" the fall of the roman empire . \" \\n \" quo vadis . \" \\nsometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . \\nsince then , epics have appeared infrequently ( \" the last emperor , \" \" braveheart \" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970\\'s ( \" roots , \" \" shogun \" ) . \\nyet , the phrase \" we who are about to die salute you \" has been absent until now . \\n \" gladiator \" begins in germania in a . d . 180 . \\nroman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . \\nhowever , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . \\nwhen commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . \\nmaximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . \\na caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . \\n ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus\\' place is never explained . ) \\nan african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus\\' wounds . \\nproximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . \\nof course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . \\nwhen commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . \\nour hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus\\' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . \\nthe similarities to \" braveheart \" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . \\nalso , like mel gibson\\'s epic , \" gladiator \" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero\\'s anger . \\nit\\'s a simple tale of good versus evil . \\nmaximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . \\ncommodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . \\nthe opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . \\n \" gladiator \" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a \" chick flick \" be a \" dick flick \" ? ) . \\nthere\\'s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . \\n ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) \\nlucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . \\njoaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . \\nin the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father\\'s love or pride . \\nthroughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who\\'s scripted as a caricature of evil . \\ni\\'ve been a russell crowe fan since \" romper stomper . \" \\nthis role doesn\\'t offer him the complexities of his parts in \" l . \\na . confidential \" and \" the insider \" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . \\nthe late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . \\ni hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . \\nmy only major quibble with \" gladiator \" is its stylized look . \\nseveral scenes are tinted . \\nwe\\'ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in \" payback \" and \" the matrix . \" \\ni don\\'t get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . \\nin \" payback \" it was merely annoying , but in \" gladiator \" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d\\'etre of the roman epic . \\n ( perhaps it\\'s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) \\nalso , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . \\n ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) \\nwith a more realistic look , \" gladiator \" could be even more satisfying than \" braveheart \" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . \\nbottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . \\n',\n",
       " b'senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far . \\ndirector penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies . \\nmarlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage . \\nhowever , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up . \\nin fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet . \\nbut there may be a light at the end of that tunnel . \\nhe signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university\\'s dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) . \\nas a result , his senses are magnified tenfold . \\nusing his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) . \\nnaturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor . \\nthe problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there\\'s not much that\\'s funny here . \\nthe film has it\\'s one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor . \\nthere obviously wasn\\'t much thought put into the plot . \\nthe entire job selection process is completely ridiculous . \\ni mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ? \\nand is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ? \\nto give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl\\'s roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) . \\napparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie . \\nhis \" intervention \" scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh . \\nand then there\\'s the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one . \\nin this case , the object of darryl\\'s amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won\\'t have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses . \\nneedless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film . \\nthis is a film that desperately needed something else . \\nbe that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground . \\nas it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can\\'t help marlon wayans get this one off the ground . \\n',\n",
       " b'in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \\nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \\nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \\nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \\nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \\nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \\ni liked that scene for two reasons . \\nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \\nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \\nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \\nit\\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \\n ( it\\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \\nit shouldn\\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \\nanyway , the deceased lawyer\\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \\nif this weren\\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\\'t know how to act in our society . \\nit also doesn\\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \\nand as played by brad pitt , he\\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\\'s just there . \\nit\\'s as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" \\nit\\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \\ni\\'ve used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\\'s performance with this year\\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\\'s in city of angels . \\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\\'s character is so shallow that she can\\'t see beyond pitt\\'s good looks . \\nthe movie\\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\\'t save meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins isn\\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \\nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \\n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\\'s character more realistically evil . ) \\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\\'m sure . \\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\\'m asking myself why . \\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\\'m going to do now . \\ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . \\ndon\\'t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .

       " b'these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes . \\nbut , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers . \\nsequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south . \\nthe way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place . \\none of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade . \\nin order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 . \\nseven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america . \\nthis time , however , third time wasn\\'t the charm and beverly hills iii was failure . \\neddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback . \\neddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop . \\nthe routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley\\'s boss . \\ndetermined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) . \\nwhen it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles . \\nthere , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring . \\nten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different . \\nin this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn\\'t work . \\nscreenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys . \\nsince foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile . \\nunfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children . \\nnice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath . \\nunlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply can\\'t balance the comedy with \" regular \" action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects . \\naction scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat . \\nto make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) . \\nin the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren\\'t any plans for beverly hills iv . \\n',\n",
       " b\"my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel . \\ni was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . \\nand when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . \\nthe film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . \\ni particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . \\ni also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . \\nat this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene . \\nit is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . \\nhowever , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . \\noff the high board . \\nsuddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . \\nup until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk . \\nif he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . \\nbut now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . \\nindeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . \\nthis includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . \\nwhile i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . \\nand the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . \\nat this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' \\nthen i realized he was , and i was watching it . \\nin the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . \\nnote : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . \\nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . \\nher refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . \\ni found this scene offensive . \\nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . \\ni think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . \\nlate in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . \\nthis could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! \\n`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . \\na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . \\nin this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . \\nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . \\ninstead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . \\ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \\n\",\n",
       " b'when i first heard that disney\\'s next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified . \\ni was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) . \\nthat effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation . \\nwhen i saw the trailers , i was thinking \" hmm . . . \\nthis isn\\'t bad at all . \\nthis just might have potential . \" \\nwhen i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features . \\ni have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? \\ni was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch . \\nphil collins\\' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs . \\nthe score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original . \\nso , the soundtrack wasn\\'t bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with . \\nthis film could be good . . . \\nbut will it be ? \\nwhen i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney\\'s tarzan is surprisingly decent . \\nthe story starts out with tarzan\\'s parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace . \\nhowever , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan\\'s parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him . \\nkala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure . \\n \" it\\'s not our kind , \" he says . \\nhe agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but \" that doesn\\'t make him my son . \" \\ntarzan grows up , vowing to be \" the best ape ever \" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can\\'t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle . \\none day , a new animal shows up : humans . \\nthis is where jane comes into the picture . \\nshe is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas . \\ntarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other . \\neven though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong . \\nclayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them . \\nworse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money . \\nwill tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? \\ni\\'m not gonna tell you , sorry . \\nyou\\'re gonna have to see for yourself . \\nand see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) . \\nthe deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in . \\nin fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox\\'s anastasia and dreamworks\\' prince of egypt . \\ncould it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? \\nthe casting is fairly good . \\ntony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . \\nnicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . \\nlance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson\\'s beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . \\nminnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . \\ni thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn\\'t have a problem with her . \\ni take back my insult on driver . \\nit\\'s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney\\'s most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . \\non the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . \\nhe might not be the strongest character in the film ( he\\'s just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed\\'s vocal work contributes greatly . \\nbut if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o\\'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . \\nshe also has a fiesty attitude ( \" i\\'m gonna kill ya ! \" \\nshe says , more than once ) . \\ni almost sung along with her during one of the film\\'s best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human\\'s camp , via song , er , scatting \" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah \" . \\ni can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she\\'s a good singer . \\nnot that she was the only funny character in the film , though . \\nwayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into \" un-sanitary \" water . \\n ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) . \\nthe songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . \\nthis sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . \\ni tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . \\nthe story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . \\nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the \\'n sync version of \" trashing the camp \" from the film . \\ni heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . \\ni was upset that it wasn\\'t , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like \\'n sync to see tarzan . \\noh , well . . . \\noverall , i was enthralled with tarzan . \\ni wouldn\\'t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney\\'s greatest achievements . \\ni give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough\\'s tarzan . \\n',\n",
       " b'cinematically speaking , gordon parks\\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \\na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman\\'s \" black private dick that\\'s a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \\nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \\nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film\\'s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \\nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \\nthis fact also explains why john singleton\\'s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \\nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_\\'s plot doesn\\'t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \\ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \\nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972\\'s _shaft\\'s_big_score ! _ and 1973\\'s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \\nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \\nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \\nbut that\\'s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \\npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson\\'s way toward commanding this film . \\npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \\nhowever , he isn\\'t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples\\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \\nit\\'s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that\\'s exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \\nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson\\'s impressive star turn doesn\\'t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \\nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \\ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \\nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft\\'s sidekick rasaan . \\nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \\n ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn\\'t even have one sex scene . ) \\nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he\\'s not really an action director . \\nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \\nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it\\'s just that there\\'s nothing terribly inventive about them . \\nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they\\'re unsurprising and conventional . \\nbut if there\\'s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it\\'s make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \\nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes\\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \\neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \\nstyle doesn\\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\\'s of little consequence . \\nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \\n',\n",
       " b'fritz lang\\'s first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town . \\njoe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago . \\nhe is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can\\'t save up enough money to marry her . \\nshe takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher . \\nbefore she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye . \\na year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station . \\ndriving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand . \\nbut the deputy sheriff \" buggs \" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him . \\nhe accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl . \\nthe sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect . \\nlocked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence . \\nin the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping . \\nfueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can\\'t get through to the prisoner\\'s jail cell . \\nthe sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn\\'t look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him . \\nsomehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies . \\nkatherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died . \\nthe next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses . \\njoe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge . \\nhe thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob . \\nan ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder . \\nkatherine , not knowing he\\'s alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death . \\nthe defense claims that it can\\'t be a charge of murder without a corpse . \\nthe trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn\\'t have been at the jail . \\nthe sheriff also lies , saying he can\\'t identify anyone in the mob . \\nbut proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film . \\nas for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe . \\nin the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive . \\nwhen the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened . \\nkatherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . \\nbut don\\'t blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive . \\nmgm couldn\\'t bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching . \\ninstead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script . \\nto lang\\'s credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . \\nhis portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . \\nyou couldn\\'t help get the feeling that the citizens didn\\'t care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves . \\ntheir reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren\\'t going to be convicted . \\nlang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident . \\nhe does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" . . . because i\\'m a scientist . \\nthat\\'s what we do ! \" \\n--- dr . alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats . \\nalright folks , stop me if you\\'ve heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal\\'s field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth . \\noh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time . \\nsound familiar ? \\nsuch is the plot of the destination films release of bats . \\ndina meyer stars as the \" bat specialist \" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently . \\nwith the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton\\'s character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! ) . \\ni have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . \\nthere\\'s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . \\nin this respect , the film never disappointed me . \\nthis film reaches a level that transcends the \" so bad it\\'s good \" level and borders on the downright insane . \\nthe effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . \\ni challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . \\nthankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . \\ndina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . \\nthe latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . \\nwhile one never really gets the impression that meyer\\'s character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . \\nshe gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she\\'s nice to look at for an hour and a half . \\nlou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . \\nalthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what\\'s going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . \\nthe only bad performance in the film is that of leon\\'s . \\nhe is relegated to the \" i\\'m not sticking around here ! \" \\ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . \\nanyone who can\\'t immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . \\neven if he hadn\\'t been the villain in just about every film he\\'s ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . \\nin fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . \\nif the plot doesn\\'t sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . \\nan entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor\\'s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . \\na government official blows off shelia\\'s instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats\\' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . \\na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . \\nfinally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it\\'s single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we\\'re lucky to even get kevin smith\\'s dogma ) . \\nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets . \\nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what\\'s going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key . \\ntherefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . \\nbeing able to see the puppeteer\\'s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . \\nafter all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don\\'t say you haven\\'t been warned . \\ntrust me when i say that it\\'s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . \\ni just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . \\nshe\\'s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" sometimes the \\'green mile\\' seems sooooo long . \" \\nindeed . \\nand any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review . \\non a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length . \\nthe mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to \" old sparky , \" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana\\'s cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 . \\npaul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you\\'ve got mail ) is the head guard of e-block , otherwise known as death row . \\nkeeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility . \\nit is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they \" talk to \" the convicts instead of yelling at them . \\nthis practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars . \\ninto his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls . \\nimmediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner . \\nperhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark . \\nor perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he \" takes back \" paul\\'s bladder infection thereby restoring him to health . \\nbased on steven king\\'s 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner \" fry \" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he\\'s witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor . \\nwhile it is mr . hanks \" everyman \" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting . \\nall involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr . duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization . \\nif only the story were more credible . \\nwriter/director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy/allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual , relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power . \\nmr . darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters . \\nwas it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ? \\nby not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts\\' presence on e-block , the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out , making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted . \\nthis is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched . \\nmuch has also been made of coffey\\'s christ-like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures , coffey\\'s powers are shrouded in mystery , taking on the feel of a circus trick , coupled with a voodoo-like \" i feel your pain \" transference . \\nin contrast , there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god . \\nthe genuine \" gifts of healing \" listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god . \\ntrue spiritual healing ( with few exceptions ) requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed . \\nsuch believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism , but from the revealed word of god . \\n',\n",
       " b'you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they\\'re as real as life . \\ni once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person\\'s brain with microwaves . \\nthen i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . \\ni even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . \\nthese people had what are known as \" conspiracy theories \" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . \\na little imagination goes a long way . \\nin richard donner\\'s conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . \\nhis latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day\\'s work for him . \\nhe combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . \\nupstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . \\nlucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . \\nwhat she doesn\\'t know is that jerry\\'s interest in her is far more than , well , professional . \\nhe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . \\nbut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry\\'s ideas and his limited-circulation \" conspiracy theory \" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice\\'s help . \\none of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . \\npart of this is a result of the film\\'s slow pace . \\nit takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . \\nat over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it\\'s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . \\ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we\\'re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite \" black elements \" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . \\nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . \\nbig deal , we\\'ve seen it all before . \\nwatching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . \\nnow , when i say it took forever to set up the \" relationship \" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . \\noh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . \\nyou see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . \\nthe two just don\\'t click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he\\'s been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . \\nthe script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . \\ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . \\neven gibson\\'s usual gift for ad lib couldn\\'t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry\\'s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . \\nunfortunately , much of what\\'s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what\\'s going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it\\'s never followed through . \\nfor example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . \\nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man\\'s lungs for chlorine . \\nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . \\nyou know what happens then ? \\nnothing , zip , nada . \\nno follow-up whatsoever , so what\\'s the significance ? \\nokay , here\\'s another one . \\na couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel \" the catcher in the rye \" . \\njerry also has a bunch of copies . \\nwhenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . \\nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we\\'re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . \\nnot when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . \\nthe point becomes totally extraneous . \\noh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? \\nyeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . \\nthat\\'s about it . \\nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he\\'s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . \\nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . \\nthis guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . \\nokay , here\\'s my theory . \\nthis really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! \\nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over . \\n',\n",

       " b'since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they\\'re portraying , it\\'s fitting to say that \" beloved \" come as a real shock as a film . \\nit\\'s confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i\\'ve seen all year , and that\\'s not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . \\n \" beloved \" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , \" beloved \" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . \\n \" beloved \" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . \\nwhen the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . \\nsethe is proud , though , and will not move . \\nher sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . \\na couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . \\nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . \\nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies \" it ain\\'t evil . \\nit\\'s just sad . \" \\nsome more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . \\nbut when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . \\nher name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . \\nshe stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . \\nthey let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . \\n \" beloved \" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . \\nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . \\nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , \" they took my milk ! \" \\nworst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \\nshe runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don\\'t leave them alone . \\nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn\\'t regret it . \\nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . \\nof course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren\\'t flat out told that until later on in the film . \\nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . \\nthus , \" beloved \" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , \" solaris , \" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . \\nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . \\n \" beloved \" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . \\nthe most interesting films are the ones that don\\'t explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . \\nsethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she\\'s being played by oprah winfrey . \\nit\\'s been well over a decade since her last major performance in \" the color purple , \" but judging from these two films , i\\'ll bet she\\'s one of the best actresses working today . . . if \\nshe was strictly an actress . \\nher talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that\\'s a shame because she brings so much to this movie . \\nemotion . \\nsadness . \\nstrength . \\nwatching the strong sethe , who\\'s so afraid of the past that she\\'s built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . \\nshe makes it real . \\nthat\\'s not to say this is a perfect film . \\nin fact , i\\'d wager to say that the fact that it\\'s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . \\nwhile oprah\\'s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i\\'m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn\\'t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . \\nit doesn\\'t necessarily move as though they\\'re memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \\nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that\\'s the point . \\nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \\nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \\njonathan demme\\'s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \\nthere\\'s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \\nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \\neveryone has been raving about thandie newton\\'s performance , and how it should be rewarded . \\nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \\nact like a baby . \\nthrow things . \\nstumble around . \\nchew food with your mouth open . \\ni do think there\\'s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it\\'s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother\\'s loss of reality towards the end . \\nit\\'s not that newton isn\\'t great : she\\'s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \\nit\\'s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \\ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , \" beloved \" has still not done well . \\ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \\nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic \" caligula , \" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \\nalthough i respect \" beloved , \" i can\\'t say that i really enjoyed it . \\n',\n",

\" \\nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \\nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \\nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don\\'t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don\\'t , love each other anymore . \\nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \\nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn\\'t mind doing things differently than they were planned . \\nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \\nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \\nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \\nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character\\'s eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \\nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson\\'s films , stepmom . \\nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \\nif it wasn\\'t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year\\'s best picture . \\nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer\\'s the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \\nalthough i wouldn\\'t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film\\'s most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \\nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ?

       " b'there\\'s more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . \\nin how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . \\nall the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . \\nmotion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . \\nthe \" quilting bee \" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma\\'s husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna\\'s daughter . \\nthe project they\\'re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy\\'s granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . \\nshe\\'s spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it\\'s better to marry a friend or a lover . \\none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . \\nfrom winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . \\nthe performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script\\'s weaknesses . \\nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . \\nthere are probably too many characters . \\nso , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . \\nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . \\nthere are other episodes as well : the love of anna\\'s life , marianna\\'s soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend\\'s husband . \\nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn\\'s story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . \\nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . \\nthe stories are all well-told , but it\\'s difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . \\nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . \\nthere isn\\'t enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . \\nto put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn\\'t \" do much \" for me . \\non the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . \\nfinn\\'s segment is by far the most compelling , because she\\'s the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else\\'s experiences . \\nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . \\nif there\\'s a disappointment here , it\\'s that the script doesn\\'t have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . \\n',\n",
       " b'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller\\'s crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \\ntheir latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \\nthe main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn\\'t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who\\'s wise to the world , but he doesn\\'t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \\nthat main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film\\'s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" \\nthe dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who\\'s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody\\'s cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who\\'s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! \" ) . \\nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it\\'s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \\nif that doesn\\'t give you a good idea of this film\\'s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude\\'s rug . \\nthey\\'ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \\nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn\\'t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \\nunfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude\\'s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \\nsoon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \\nmeanwhile , the big lebowski\\'s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \\nthe plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \\nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival\\'s \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \\nthe film doesn\\'t feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens\\' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude\\'s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \\nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \\nthere\\'s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech . \\nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" \\nshouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on . \\nby the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \\nhe also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn\\'t like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he\\'s getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \\nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don\\'t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \\ni think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . \\naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \\n \" it\\'s good knowin\\' he\\'s out there , the dude , takin\\' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end . \\ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . \\n',\n",

       " b'for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . \\nsadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . \\nand not a particularly good one at that . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\nmi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it\\'ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise\\'s firing gun just so they can die really cool . \\nearly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . \\nin one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other\\'s eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . \\nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . \\nwhy ? \\ni haven\\'t the foggiest . \\ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . \\nwith mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . \\nit\\'s possible that these \" spies \" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . \\nthe scenes i\\'ve described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . \\ngod forbid . \\nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . \\nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . \\ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . \\nbetween the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . \\nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . \\nsure it\\'s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . \\nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that\\'s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\\\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . \\nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . \\nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously . \\ncruise grins a little too slyly . \\nthe cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . \\nhere cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . \\nhe\\'s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90\\'s ) . \\nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise\\'s initial \" i\\'m the man ! \" \\ncharm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . \\nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won\\'t stop . \\nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could\\'ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . \\nwe\\'ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . \\nit isn\\'t done any differently here . \\nthe action is pure hard target \\\\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . \\nhe\\'s cool for sure but he\\'s made to be as empty as the movie . \\nthe actor isn\\'t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . \\nwhen he\\'s not beaming away , he\\'s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo\\'s editing seriously undermines the effort . \\nhe fetishizes cruise\\'s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . \\ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he\\'s really austin powers . \\nin a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . \\nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . \\nthe lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ?

' \\nin down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent . \\nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \\nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about . \\nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \\nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \\nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \\nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \\nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \\nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \\nfor once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \\ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \\nit's almost as much fun as the film . \\n\",\n",
       " b'bob the happy bastard\\'s quickie review : \\ni must admit , no doubt\\'s single \" new \" is quite catchy . \\nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . \\nthe result ? \\na movie that\\'s just as good as that song , really . \\nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . \\nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he\\'s been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop\\'s strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . \\nreally , it\\'s all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . \\nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . \\nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . \\nthink of it as a , well , ending . \\nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it\\'s never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . \\nhowever , it\\'s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn\\'t . \\n',\n",

interest in insects and other outdoor life . \\none day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . \\nher name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with

know one another . \\nthey gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . \\nlucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . \\nthis is not clear to lucas , however . \\nhe still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen . \\nwe soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . \\nthey throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . \\nsurprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . \\nthe next scene is brilliant . \\nmaggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . \\nshe tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . \\nhe rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . \\nin lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . \\nbut maggie is written smarter than that . \\nshe understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . \\nnext we are

tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . \\nthis scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires .

\\n ( diedre\\'s therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it\\'s not her\\'s . \\ntherapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) . \\nhaving successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : \" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? \\noh , that\\'s right . \\n\\'i\\'m sorry , but your time is up ! \\' \" \\nthis is what passes for humor in the film . \\nthe audience doesn\\'t necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can\\'t believe they\\'re watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . \\nnick mancuso\\'s chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler\\'s character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . \\nin between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie\\'s best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is . \\nin exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts \" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! \" \\n ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) \\nand so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . \\ni won\\'t reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . \\nmolly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! \\nmolly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family\\'s to spy upon them , that \" she\\'s crazy . \" \\nyou\\'d be pretty crazy too if you\\'d rented this turkey . \\ni\\'d avoid it unless it\\'s on tv and you come across it . \\nif you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn\\'t spend money renting it . \\n',\n",

       " b'director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) . \\nfilm is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . \\nbut most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story . \\nso whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review . \\nand when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . \\nfincher\\'s the game is no exception to this . \\nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time . \\nfincher hasn\\'t made a film since \" seven , \" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever . \\nso it is about time he made another film . \\nand what a ride it is . \\nthe game isn\\'t quite as powerful as \" seven , \" but in some ways it is better . \\noverall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty . \\nit walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end . \\nthe outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight . \\nunfortunately , unlike \" the usual suspects , \" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . \\nhowever , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent . \\nthe game is told completely from its main character\\'s point of view . \\nnicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman . \\nhe lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion . \\nfor his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services . \\n \" it will make your life fun again , \" his brother promises . \\nas skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates . \\nseeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company . \\njim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games . \\n \" each game is suited to each person\\'s emotional and psychological needs , \" explains feingold . \\none day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests . \\neven more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company . \\nwhat he doesn\\'t realize is that the game has already begun . \\nthe phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas\\' way . \\nhow he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive . \\nthe detail involved in fincher\\'s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them . \\nwith \" seven , \" fincher had almost every single shot mean something . \\nhe also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . \\ncompared to \" seven , \" though , the game is light and comical . \\nbecause of this film\\'s sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously . \\nso don\\'t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn\\'t want you to . \\nwhat does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear . \\nif taken as it is , the game\\'s ending makes complete sense . \\nbut if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . \\nperhaps that is the reason i docked the film . \\nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen . \\nwe don\\'t really care if douglas\\' character lives or not because it isn\\'t believable . \\nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . \\nmichael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas . \\ndouglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance . \\nhis character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody . \\ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into ? \\nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? \\ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his \" falling down \" persona ) . \\nthe supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . \\nsean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas\\' brother . \\ndeborah kara unger ( from \" crash \" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . \\nin fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . \\njames rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas\\' predicament . \\nanother good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from \" shine \" ) as the book editor . \\nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . \\nthe game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . \\nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing . \\njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . \\nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects\\' did . \\nhowever , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . \\nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year\\'s best films . \\n',\n",

i\\'d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . \\nmost of the vocal performances are first-rate . \\ntom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . \\nhowever , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast . \\nkelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . \\nalthough he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on \" the simpsons \" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . \\nhe doesn\\'t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . \\nthe animation is even better than in the first . \\nespecially impressive were the textures of the figures . \\nwe can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . \\nwe can also see that bo peep is porcelain . \\nas you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- \" disney and pixar\\'s \\'toy story 2\\' \" -- this is pixar\\'s coming out party . \\nto celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . \\nthey made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . \\non the downside , \" toy story 2 \" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . \\noverall , though , i had a great time and found \" story 2 \" to be a worthy successor to the first \" toy story . \" \\nbottom line : this one really is fun for the whole family ! \\n',\n",

\\nbecause there is more . \\nmuch , much more . \\nand this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures . \\nhow the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn\\'s 1985 comedy classic , \" clue : the movie . \" \\ngoing into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty-minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble . \\nsince the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing \" comedy \" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill\\'s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark . \\na few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all . \\non the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis . \\nperry , innocuously enjoyable on tv\\'s \" friends , \" plays the same exact sitcom-style character in all of his movies ( from 1997\\'s \" fools rush in \" to 1999\\'s \" three to tango \" ) , and it has become a crushing bore . \\nmeanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background . \\ntheir three female counterparts fare noticeably better . \\nbest of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative \" species \" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia . \\nhenstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent . \\namanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy . \\nit is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts . \\nfinally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time . \\nalso popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in \" the green mile , \" as jimmy\\'s largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs . \\nwhen \" the whole nine yards \" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit . \\na great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ?

       " b'the following review encompasses two versions of dune : \\ndune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \\nthe film\\'s visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \\ndune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \\nit was disowned by director david lynch but it\\'s considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \\nquality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \\n * * * the review * * * \\nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert\\'s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \\ndirector david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \\nthe screenplay was lynch\\'s own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \\ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \\nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that\\'s home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \\nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \\nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \\nmost importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to \" fold space \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \\nlynch\\'s film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story\\'s two main strands . \\none is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \\nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \\nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \\nunfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \\nthe thinking among universal\\'s oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \\nwith lynch\\'s initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \\nwhat a great idea ! \\nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \\nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \\nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \\nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\\'t care much for them . \\nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \\ndune is also a very serous film . \\nthe constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \\nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \\nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \\nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\\' star wars trilogy . \\nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \\nit still possesses enough of lynch\\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \\nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \\nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \\nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \\nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \\nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \\nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \\nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \\nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \\nthe conclusion ? \\nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \\ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \\ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \\nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \\nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \\nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director\\'s cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \\nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \\nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \\nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \\nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \\ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\\'s handiwork there\\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \\nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \\nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\\'s storyline . \\npaul\\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \\nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \\npaul\\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \\nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \\nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \\nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \\nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \\nthere\\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \\nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \\nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \\nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \\nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \\nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\\'t even in herbert\\'s book . \\nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \\nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \\ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \\nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \\nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we\\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \\non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \\nstill , as one of this century\\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \\nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \\n',\n",

\\nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? \\ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . \\nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence . \\nthe character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . \\na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . \\nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . \\nwhen she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . \\nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . \\nwhen it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . \\nthe box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . \\ncontains nudity and graphic violence \" . \\nwhile both is certainly true , there doesn\\'t seem to be much of either in any large amounts . \\nbesides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . \\nas for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . \\nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com . \\nit has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . \\nbesides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice . \\ni haven\\'t had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set . \\n',\n",

       " b'on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \\ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \\nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in \" lumumba . \" \\npatrice lumumba\\'s ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , \" lumumba - death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \\npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \\nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \\nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \\njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \\na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \\nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \\nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \\nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \\nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \\nlumumba won\\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \\nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \\nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \\nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \\npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s . \\n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \\nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \\nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \\nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \\nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \\nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\\'s life . \\nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \\nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \\nthe family side of patrice\\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \\ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \\nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \\nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \\nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \\nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \\n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \\nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \\n',\n",

\\nwhy , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ? \\nmore to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring \" hyperreal \" ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ? \\n \" final fantasy \" is based on a phenomenally popular video game i\\'ve never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed . \\nif you\\'re a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials . \\nwith an expression-challenged cast , \" final fantasy \" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit . \\nthe result is ugly , confusing and boring . \\nnote : the following reveals the basic plot . \\nif you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it . \\nearth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls . \\nmost of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities . \\nwhile the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach . \\nthey operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) \" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained . \\naki and dr . sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force . \\nthe waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion . \\nthey have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave . \\nthey are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out . \" \\nare you still with me ?

they\\'re cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ? \\nthe action scenes and shoot-em-ups don\\'t satisfy either . \\nthe humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can\\'t bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we\\'re missing ) . \\naki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960\\'s \" the time machine . \" \\ndrab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell-o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces . \\nstudents of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind \" final fantasy : the spirits within , \" but i found it sub-par across the board . \\n \" futurama \" does more effective battle visuals , the kids in \" south park \" are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of \" the outer limits \" does better doom and gloom sci-fi . \\nso who needs this ?

       " b'\\'pleasantville\\' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood\\'s lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed \\n ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday ) \\ncast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t . \\nwalsh , jeff daniels \\nmpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements \\ngenre : drama \\nin my opinion : \\nin short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is . \\nreview : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions . \\nthe town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant . \\nthere is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate . \\nput simply , it\\'s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for . \\nj one big note however is that it is only a 50\\'s sitcom that airs in reruns on an \" oldies \" tv station ? or is it ? \\ni had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . \\ni found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office . \\nbut it wasn\\'t until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy \" dollar theaters \" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . \\nit is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some \" healthy \" immorality is not a world at all . \\ninstead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn\\'t give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . \\nthere is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story . \\nnow i\\'m not saying that\\'s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be . \\nbesides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . \\nthe visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . \\nafter spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it\\'s hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . \\na truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . \\nthat said , the plot goes as such . \\ndavid and jennifer are two very 90\\'s high school twins with the typical \" relationship \" outline of don\\'t-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won\\'t-mess-with-yours . \\nthey demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . \\ndavid is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . \\nbut when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . \\nnevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . \\nand , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . \\nnot only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . \\npeople got hurt . \\nthey cried . \\nthey became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that\\'s when their physical world turned colors as well . \\nthis can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . \\ni hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we\\'ll never know what we could have done better . \\nuntil the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr \\n',\n",
       " b'that thing you do ! \\n ( r ) tom hanks\\'s screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice . \\nit is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this \\'60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . \\nthat thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , \" that thing you do ! \" \\nthe group\\'s members are , naturally a diverse group : there\\'s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film\\'s center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . \\nalong for the wonders\\' ride to success is jimmy\\'s perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . \\nhanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls \" the last innocent year . \" \\nthe spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it\\'s still playing in my mind as i write this ) . \\nit should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film\\'s biggest and best dramatic moment . \\nthe work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early \\'60s ; they do not appear to be \\'90s grungers playacting \" retro . \" \\nyet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it\\'s nearly nice to a fault . \\nwhile this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . \\neveryone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note . \\nthere isn\\'t much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks\\'s turn as the wonders\\' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it\\'s bland . \\nbut a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there\\'s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it\\'s just about impossible to hate . \\nit\\'s an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , \" that thing you do ! \" --quite \\npossibly for days . \\nto paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play \" that thing you do ! \" \\n',\n",
       " b'it\\'s an interesting premise . \\nour reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . \\nin truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . \\nwhat we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . \\nour bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . \\nthe sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . \\nthe matrix isn\\'t it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one\\'s brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . \\nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . \\nkeanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . \\nthe group\\'s leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is \" the one \" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . \\n>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . \\nthis , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . \\nwhat is reality ? \\nwhat is a sham ? \\nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side . \\nmore than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . \\nas viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . \\nand who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? \\nreeves , whom i\\'ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . \\nhe was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . \\nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . \\nin a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . \\ni mean , since bill and ted\\'s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really \" utilized \" keanu reeves ? \\nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne , who\\'s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . \\nvery surprising for a sci-fi movie . \\nfishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . \\nthis helps to further the aura of his character\\'s proficiency and extensive knowledge . \\nhugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence\\'s anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . \\nunfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character\\'s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . \\ncarrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus\\'s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . \\nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn\\'t in the picture . \\nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . \\nmany methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . \\nof special note is the use of the \" freeze and turn \" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . \\nthis is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . \\nthe motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . \\nplace each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . \\npretty slick . \\nthe matrix drips with style . \\nfrom the clothing to the music to the action , we\\'re watching an exaggerated version of what we\\'re used to . \\nmuch of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there\\'s a lot of kung fu , there\\'s a lot of gunplay . \\nwhen a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . \\nthere\\'s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . \\ncombined , it\\'s really like no live-action film i have ever seen . \\nthe film is not without its faults . \\nsome of the scenes and ideas are \" borrowed \" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . \\nsome of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn\\'t meant to be a joke . \\nhowever , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \\nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \\nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\\' now infamous score . \\ndah-dum . \\nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \\nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \\nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\\' music . \\nhe\\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \\nhe doesn\\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\\'s right and going against the entire town . \\n \" it\\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe\\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\\'s performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can\\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg\\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n',\n",

       " b' \" the end of the affair \" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs . \\nalthough it\\'s slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience . \\nbased on graham greene\\'s novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters . \\nthere\\'s maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile\\'s ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) . \\nsarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he\\'s just a normal guy . \\nit\\'s all work and no play with him . \\nwhile maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her . \\nunfortunately the two break up . \\nthis is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present . \\nit\\'s a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too . \\nwhile this may sound straight forward it\\'s not . \\nit\\'s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love . \\nall this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest . \\nwith great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why . \\nthe story was also well written thanks to neil jordan . \\neven though i didn\\'t read the book , there\\'s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive . \\nwhat\\'s so moving about it you ask ? \\nthe tragedy of it all . \\nit\\'s not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing . \\nit really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect . \\neveryone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces . \\nback to neil jordan\\'s script , it wasn\\'t only red roses . \\nthere were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are . \\nit also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start . \\nit keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things . \\nalso a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan . \\ni\\'d have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i\\'ve never really found his work to be up to par . \\nit just never did anything for me , until now . \\nwhen it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless . \\nthis is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore . \\nnot for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value . \\n',\n",
       " b'funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . \\nthe ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . \\nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . \\n \" get new jobs ! \" \\nwas one line , if i remember correctly . \\nat the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . \\nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . \\npatterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . \\nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . \\nthey are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . \\ngive me a break . \\nthe movie hasn\\'t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it\\'s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . \\neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . \\nget this : remington\\'s big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . \\nhe does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . \\nby the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . \\nthe acting is forgettable . \\ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it\\'s nothing he hasn\\'t done before . \\nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . \\nthe camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . \\nwhat did i expect from this movie ? \\ni dunno . \\nsome real excitement , i suppose . \\na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . \\nno such luck . \\ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingway\\'s \" the short happy life of francis macomber \" and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . \\n',\n",
       " b'writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \\nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \\ni suppose i\\'m not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it\\'s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron\\'s early works . \\nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \\nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron\\'s wing for years and years , i\\'m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \\nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \\nthe film seems to not only borrow it\\'s plot from last year\\'s similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the \\'80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter\\'s twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \\n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \\nthey get on . \\nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \\nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \\nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \\nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \\nand it\\'s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don\\'t give a damn . \\ni almost don\\'t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he\\'s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \\nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo \\'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \\nor peter o\\'toole in \" caligula . \" \\ngreat actor , horrific performance . \\nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland\\'s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \\nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone\\'s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it\\'s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \\n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it\\'s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \\nand if you don\\'t believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there\\'s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don\\'t really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \\nbut all of this doesn\\'t matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \\nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i\\'ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn\\'t figure it out when i saw it ) . \\nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that\\'s basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \\nand my god , it\\'s a long damn sit . \\nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it\\'s a wonder that it even got made . \\nwe already know that big movie studios\\' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \\ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \\nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \\neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i\\'d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \\nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \\nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \\n',\n",
       " b'it\\'s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it\\'s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . \\ni\\'d saw that it\\'s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i\\'m hardly comparing \" a simple plan \" to , say , \" rear window \" or \" strangers on a train . \" \\nyet it\\'s almost as good . \\nit\\'s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . \\nelegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , \" a simple plan \" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . \\nwithout anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don\\'t flaunt anything they don\\'t want to flaunt , they\\'ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . \\nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \\n \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . \\na little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . \\nbut , as austin powers would say , that\\'s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . \\nwhat i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it\\'s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . \\nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . \\nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . \\nin one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn\\'t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . \\ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton\\'s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . \\nthere\\'s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he\\'s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . \\nin short , probably the best piece of direction raimi\\'s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" \\'s \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman\\'s ever done ) . \\nbut the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . \\nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . \\nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . \\nthere\\'s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don\\'t come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . \\nduring the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can\\'t do this , can they ? \" \\nstreeming through my head . \\nin fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen\\'s [superior , but forget about it] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then \\nagain , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i\\'d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . \\ninstead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . \\nmost particularly , billy bob thornton\\'s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . \\nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there\\'s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we\\'re not totally laughing at him . \\nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \\njacob\\'s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \\nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \\ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \\nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he\\'s ever given and further proof that he\\'s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don\\'t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn\\'t been in the same year ) because he\\'s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \\nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it\\'s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \\nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton\\'s declining working man to chelcie ross\\' amiable town sheriff . \\neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \\nand if i had any complaints about the film , it\\'s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \\nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you\\'re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn\\'t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \\nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \\ni won\\'t reveal it , but it\\'s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn\\'t already too much of that anyway . \\nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \\nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it\\'s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i\\'m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . \\nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \\nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i\\'ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \\nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \\n',\n",
       " b'most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . \\nmy family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . \\ni think he\\'s very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . \\nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . \\nunrestrained by physical boundaries , allen\\'s humor comes shining through . \\nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen\\'s intelligent observations of life . \\nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . \\nin 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they\\'d never seen before . \\ntoy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . \\nmany critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . \\nantz , however , has upped the ante considerably . \\ndisney\\'s a bug\\'s life isn\\'t due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . \\nby beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience\\'s thirst for computer-animated films . \\nbut don\\'t let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . \\nin the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . \\nin 1997 , it was the volcano duel . \\nin my opinion , dante\\'s peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . \\nvolcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . \\nin 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . \\nfirst was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it\\'s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . \\nbut now , it\\'s even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . \\nwho will prevail ? \\ntime will tell , but i\\'m sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . \\nthis may sound like i didn\\'t like antz ; on the contrary , i\\'d put it up there with toy story . \\nbut due to it\\'s pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn\\'t appear in disney\\'s version . \\nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . \\nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks\\' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . \\nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . \\nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . \\nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen\\'s shtick and franz kafka\\'s metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . \\nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \\n \" when you\\'re the middle child in a family of five million . . . \" he comments about his neglected childhood . \\none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . \\nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . \\nbala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . \\nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there\\'s a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . \\nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . \\nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . \\nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . \\nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . \\nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . \\nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . \\nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . \\nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . \\nthe second half of the film revolves around z\\'s kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . \\nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . \\nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . \\nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i\\'m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . \\nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . \\nvisually , it\\'s an exciting rush of adrenaline . \\nbut don\\'t be fooled . . . \\nlittle kids shouldn\\'t see this , as they may just try and copy it . \\nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \\nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \\nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \\nvisually , it\\'s as stunning as what dreams may come . \\nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren\\'t limited by gravity . \\nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \\none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \\nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \\nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy\\'s shoe . \\nit\\'s truly a great example of film making at its finest . \\nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants\\' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \\nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \\nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \\ndo they ? ) . \\nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \\nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \\ndisney\\'s a bug\\'s life looks good , but i don\\'t know if they will be able to best dreamworks\\' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \\nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \\nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \\nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \\nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he\\'s done in the past few years . \\nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \\nin fact , i\\'m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \\nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \\nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \\nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \\ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \\nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \\nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she\\'s effective nonetheless . \\ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \\ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \\njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won\\'t recognize her voice either . \\nmany people will recognize grant shaud\\'s voice as the foreman . \\nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \\nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it\\'s grosses . \\nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \\ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \\nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \\ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \\nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \\nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \\nmost of it will go over young children\\'s heads . \\ndoes that mean you shouldn\\'t take kids to see it ? \\nnot at all . \\nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one . \\nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us . \\npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . \\nthankfully , it\\'s not subtle in either aspects . \\nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . \\nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . \\nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . \\nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . \\nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it\\'s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . \\ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it\\'s still advisable to leave really young children at home . \\nhave i confused you enough ? \\nif you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you\\'ll enjoy it the most . \\n',\n",
       " b'jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . \\nfrom time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . \\non the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis\\' king kong . \\nand , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . \\nhush is one such example . \\nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn\\'t such a prime example of motion picture tedium . \\nthe film opens , as many so-called \" psychological thrillers \" do , by posing as a light drama . \\nwe are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks\\' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . \\njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . \\nthe moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . \\nsoon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . \\nonce that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . \\nas long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it\\'s a declaration of war . \\nhush has three very simple problems : it\\'s incredibly dumb , it\\'s incredibly boring , and it\\'s incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . \\nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow\\'s bare buttocks . \\nfrankly , it\\'s embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange\\'s stature give a performance like this -- it\\'s like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . \\nmeanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . \\nas in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . \\nhere , it\\'s mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . \\nof course , since schaech\\'s character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it\\'s impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . \\nmaybe someone should ask him if he\\'s familiar with oedipus . \\nmartha is , of course , the evil one . \\nhow do we know she\\'s evil ? \\nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . \\non the other hand , helen is a good girl . \\nthe evidence for this is that she\\'s nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . \\nthat\\'s about it for character development . \\nbeyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . \\nhowever , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . \\neither there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . \\nbefore the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . \\nviewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . \\ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . \\nmost entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren\\'t especially good . \\nfilms like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . \\nin general , however , they\\'re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . \\nthat\\'s not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . \\nindeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . \\n',\n",
       " b'm : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . \\nit tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it\\'s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . \\nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . \\nthe coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . \\nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . \\nexcept for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . \\nas for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . \\nm : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . \\nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . \\nthe only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film\\'s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . \\nit\\'s a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . \\nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . \\njohn woo ( \" broken arrow \" / \" face/off \" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can\\'t seem to handle dialogue and suspense . \\nthe star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . \\ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . \\ntheir romance didn\\'t work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn\\'t convincing . \\nthe film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . \\nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . \\nfirst , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . \\nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . \\nwhich explains the film\\'s mythic theme . . . as \\nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . \\nthe one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . \\nat least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . \\nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . \\nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . \\nhe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . \\nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . \\nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . \\nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . \\nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . \\nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . \\nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . \\nhe is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . \\nhopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . \\nactually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . \\nin seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . \\nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . \\nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . \\nrobert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first \" mission , \" who is noted for doing \" chinatown \" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . \\nthe terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . \\nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . \\nethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean\\'s getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . \\nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick\\'s everyone\\'s ass . \\nif i was only entertained by this . . .

( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . \\nbut she\\'s not the only ghost from finn\\'s past that\\'s going to be paying him a visit . \\ncomparisons with the afore-mentioned \" romeo + juliet \" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . \\n \" great expectations \" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where \" romeo \" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . \\nthe movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki\\'s sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that\\'s steamier than the film\\'s ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . \\nthe eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . \\nacting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay\\'s occasional slip-ups . \\nhawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from \" gattaca \" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . \\npaltrow\\'s estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . \\nwhile the actress is at her icily seductive best , we\\'re not told very much about her character , and as a result , it\\'s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don\\'t quite understand why she\\'s fueling his fire . \\nrobert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . \\nalfonso cuaron\\'s visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie\\'s climax . \\nanother problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren\\'t familiar with the story . \\ndespite its script flaws , though , \" great expectations \" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . \\nand frankly , it\\'s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . \\nperhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine\\'s day , will end up helping \" great expectations \" \\' seemingly average box office chances after all . \\n',\n",

       " b'the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . \\nwe are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . \\nthis year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . \\ni have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . \\nthat tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . \\nin the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o\\'connell . \\nhe teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . \\nevelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . \\nrick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that\\'s why she chose him to lead her there . \\nalso tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn\\'s brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . \\nnow in hamunaptra , the three uncover \" the book of the dead . \" \\nthe curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . \\nalong with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . \\nnot only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . \\ndon\\'t expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . \\nthis movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . \\non the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that\\'s up to you to decide . \\nthere is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . \\nthe state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . \\nwe are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human\\'s skin . \\nthese may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . \\nas of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . \\nin the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . \\nwhen playing \" george \" in disney\\'s george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . \\ni would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . \\nin the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . \\nalthough brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . \\nweisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . \\nthe way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . \\nevelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah\\'s , didn\\'t get much personal attention . \\nin many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . \\nin the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . \\nthere are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . \\nthe mummy could have gotten an \" a \" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . \\ni didn\\'t mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . \\nthe cinematography is amazing in the mummy . \\nparticularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . \\nthe costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . \\nfrom ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . \\nthe bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start . \\n',\n",

       " b'one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet\\'s \" gloria , \" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . \\nsuddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . \\nwhen a movie is over , aren\\'t we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? \\ni thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn\\'t have been anything to talk about in the first place . \\nto be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy\\'s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \\nright before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \\neventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \\nmeanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn\\'t commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . \\nwhen he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . \\ngloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don\\'t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \\nthe previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can\\'t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \\nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn\\'t completely unbearable to watch . \\ni liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \\nthese bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \\nthroughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" \\nas gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn\\'t sound realistic at all . \\nin the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone\\'s performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . \\nalthough not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . \\njean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . \\nall other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria\\'s friend whom she turns to for help . \\nsony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don\\'t blame them . \\nthey declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . \\nalthough how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . \\nalthough stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995\\'s \" casino \" or 1996\\'s \" last dance \" if you don\\'t believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . \\n',\n",

       " b\"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . \\nthat concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . \\nhowever , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . \\nthe author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . \\nwhatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . \\ninstead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . \\nthe novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . \\nfirst of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . \\nthe plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . \\nat the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . \\nthey are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . \\nat first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . \\nfinally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . \\nwhen he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . \\nbut , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . \\nthe time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . \\nfor h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . \\neven the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . \\ncompared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . \\nof course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . \\nfor example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . \\nsome of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . \\nbut , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . \\nthe acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby . \\nyvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . \\nhowever , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days . \\n\",\n",

       " b'perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . \\nthere is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . \\nwhereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . \\nthe latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers\\' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie\\'s story . \\nunlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . \\nit runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film\\'s length . \\ncontrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . \\nin this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . \\nwith its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . \\nthe script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . \\nbut , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . \\nthe viewers don\\'t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . \\nand right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . \\nas the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . \\nbillions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- \" farms \" our life energy . \\nonly a select group of individuals knows of the \" real \" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \\nmorpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . \\nthe cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . \\nthe set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . \\nthe costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . \\nfor instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of \" agents \" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . \\nthe casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn\\'t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . \\nsupports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . \\none of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year\\'s science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would\\'ve worked from a different approach . \\nthe alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . \\nthe better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . \\n',\n",

a place of blooming blossoms , green forests and clear waters ; a place really worth sacrificing your life for . \\nbecause of its lack of three dimensionality , the film looses most of its possibilities , but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes , amusing performances ( especially by willem dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought , depicted in many different ways throughout the movie . \\nduring the film , the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created . \\n \" the matrix \" , despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts , ends with a light at the end of the tunnel . \\n \" existenz \" does not . \\nit is a one time experience , ending in blood , gore and madness - a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow . \\n',\n",

       " b\"while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club . \\nboth films consist of a predominately male cast . \\nboth films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . \\nand both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . \\nwhile boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . \\na generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . \\npaying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . \\nas is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . \\nboiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . \\nanother similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . \\nsome people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . \\nif you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . \\nif you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . \\ngiovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth . \\nafter dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . \\nhe agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers . \\nlearning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . \\nafter stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . \\nat this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . \\nribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad . \\nthe two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . \\nthe transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . \\nthe supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless . \\nben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . \\nthe energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . \\nthe only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . \\nthere is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . \\ndue to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . \\nthe movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy . \\nin having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . \\nit doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into . \\none satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . \\notherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . \\n\",\n",
       " b'one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , \" se7en \" is just a few steps away from brilliance . \\nhowever , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . \\nthe film received mixed reviews upon release , but there\\'s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . \\nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . \\nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . \\nthis piece of work is 100% intensity . \\nit\\'s uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . \\n \" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . \" \\nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \\nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \\nthis is the guy who directed the ominous \" alien 3 \" . \\n \" se7en \" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \\nit\\'s human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \\nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \\nafter the most bizarre opening credits i\\'ve ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \\nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \\nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \\nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills\\' wife ) . \\nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \\nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \\nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that\\'s seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \\nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in \" paradise lost \" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \\nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \\nit\\'s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won\\'t give that away . \\nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \\nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the \" sinners \" suffer for it . \\nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \\nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \\nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \\nif they didn\\'t , it would be one short movie !

       " b'if you\\'re going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? \\nif you\\'re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? \\nwhile watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . \\nwhat he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . \\ncelebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he\\'s familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . \\nallen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . \\nbranagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . \\nthe usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . \\nunless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it\\'s not likely that you\\'ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . \\naside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . \\nbranagh proves once again that he\\'s a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . \\nthe problem is that he\\'s the same character allen always plays , a character who\\'s getting more than a little dull to watch . \\ni mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? \\n-- he hates his work , and he can\\'t be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . \\nhe brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he\\'s receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it\\'s pretty hard to care about him . \\nin addition , isn\\'t allen capable of creating characters who aren\\'t just like him ? \\ni know he is , but he didn\\'t do it in celebrity . \\nthe vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . \\ndavis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . \\nsome of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they\\'re not likable people . \\nonly famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon\\'s new novel , has any life . \\nthe men in the picture don\\'t do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . \\nwhat\\'s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its \" themes \" are . \\nallen seems to think that he\\'s making an insightful movie about the way \" normal \" people look at celebrities . \\nthe main problem with this is that the character with whom we\\'re supposed to identify , simon , is not a \" normal \" guy -- he\\'s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . \\nthe other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . \\nin addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , \" it\\'s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! \" ) . \\ncelebrity is arguably allen\\'s biggest misfire to date . \\nit does have a few good scenes -- theron\\'s super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . \\nbut celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen\\'s point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . \\nif he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . \\ni , for one , don\\'t enjoy feeling like an outsider . \\n',\n",

       " b'in my review of \" the spy who shagged me , \" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore . \\nthe cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing . \\n \" scream 3 \" provides the latest proof of this rule . \\nin los angeles production has begun on \" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , \" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) . \\nhowever , life soon starts imitating art , and \" stab \" cast members turn up stabbed . \\nsmelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in \" stab 3 . \" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name . \\n . \\n . \\nuntil she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice . \\nthe late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy . \\nhe notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with . \\nindeed , \" scream 3 \" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney\\'s mother maureen before the beginning of the original \" scream . \" \\nat the scene of each murder in \" scream 3 , \" the killer leaves a photo of sidney\\'s mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer . \\nto find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen\\'s missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films . \\n ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer\\'s relationship to sidney is ) . \\nunlike its predecessors , \" scream 3 \" doesn\\'t have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer . \\nthe characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don\\'t even care who the killer is . \\nthe jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ? \\nthe kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ? \\nthe driven young director ( scott foley ) ? \\nthe ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ? \\nthe character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random . \\nwes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it\\'s quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen . \\nthe series\\' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious . \\npossibly it\\'s the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it\\'s that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche . \\ni groaned as an attack on sidney from the first \" scream \" was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home . \\nat some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas . \\n \" scream 3 \" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles . \\nlook for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from \" seinfeld \" ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point . \\nall these bit players put forth more effort than the series\\' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- \" scream \" job search . \\nanother prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying \" the blair witch project \" \\'s web strategy . \\n \" scream 3 \" has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie . \\nthe sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the \" latest \\'stab 3\\' news . \" \\nthere\\'s also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more \" stab \" scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) . \\ncraven and company promise that this is the last installment in the \" scream \" series . \\nwhile i hope that\\'s true , i don\\'t hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters . \\nthere\\'s a \" halloween h2k \" in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in \" h20 , \" and a \" freddy vs . jason \" has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were \" killed off . \" \\nthere\\'s bound to be a \" scream 4 \" someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes . \\nbottom line : they should have called this one \" yawn . \" \\n',\n",

       " b' \" desperate measures \" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer \\'97 . \\nfor some reason , it was delayed until hollywood\\'s traditional dumping ground : january . \\nnow that it\\'s out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it\\'s a simple yet highly entertaining film . \\nmichael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who\\'s bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . \\nkeaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . \\nhe succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . \\nthe police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . \\nthe film definately has it\\'s flaws . \\nthe plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . \\nalso , after keaton\\'s escape , garcia\\'s captain barks at him \" how many men have to die to save your kid\\'s life ? \" \\nwhich the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark . \\nthe thing is , it\\'s a vaild point . \\nhow many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? \\nwhat\\'s the greater good here ? \\nmany lives or one life ? \\nif movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia\\'s character . \\nplace him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else . \\nalas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience\\'s strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable . \\ndespite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about \" desperate measures \" outnumber the bad . \\nthe main highlight would be keaton\\'s performance . \\nthe character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely . \\nhe\\'s not as menacing as he was in \" pacific heights \" or even as menacing as he was in \" batman \" ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he\\'s evil . \\neven the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . \\nso much so that i didn\\'t mind it in the slightest . \\nand another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you\\'ve seen a billion times before . \\nand for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen . \\nbut it doesn\\'t , and that\\'s creative . \\n[r] \\n',\n",

       " b'when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . \\nwhile i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don\\'t think that they are completely to blame for this movie\\'s failure . \\nit appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the \" unseen \" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . \\nso special effects or not , if the story isn\\'t the least bit scary , you aren\\'t going to end up with a very frightening movie . \\nthe thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . \\ndern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . \\nas i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern\\'s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . \\nnever a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . \\nliam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . \\nhe decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . \\nhe tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . \\nand he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . \\nlike the original , taylor\\'s character is the star of the movie . \\nbut since she doesn\\'t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . \\nand let\\'s face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . \\ni\\'ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren\\'t in it . \\nbut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . \\nthey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . \\nthere really isn\\'t much of a story here . \\njust endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . \\nand the special effects are great . \\nin many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . \\nin other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the \" cool shots \" quota . \\nat no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . \\nbut not scary . \\nthen we have the set . \\nwhen i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . \\nbut it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . \\nthis included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . \\nwhat part did these rooms play in the story ? \\nabsolutely none . \\nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . \\nthen we have the actors . \\nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites . \\nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . \\ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role . \\nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . \\nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . \\ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . \\nzeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . \\nthe fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . \\nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good . \\nfortunately that is something she does very well . \\nwhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . \\nit\\'s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . \\nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . \\nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999\\'s horror movies , the blair witch project . \\nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . \\nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . \\nif the story sucks , it\\'s all downhill from there . \\nmy advice ?

       " b'in 1994 , an insider\\'s look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton\\'s 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . \\nnow , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . \\nbut the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . \\nit is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . \\njack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . \\nhe is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . \\nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton\\'s ideals and helps to organize the campaign . \\nhe joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . \\ngovernor stanton\\'s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . \\nto help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby \" the dustbuster \" holden ( kathy bates ) . \\nthe acting throughout primary colors is superb . \\nit would be worth seeing the movie for bates\\' wild performance alone . \\nshe enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . \\ntravolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . \\nemma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can\\'t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . \\nthe problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . \\nprimary colors treads lightly on this issue . \\nthough stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . \\nin fact , most of the \" bad guys \" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . \\nrather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . \\nalthough the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president\\'s current troubles ) . \\nprimary colors\\' chief problem is its length . \\nit runs about 15 minutes too long . \\nthere are some scenes which could have easily been cut . \\nfor example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . \\nthe scene\\'s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton\\'s character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . \\nthe extra length isn\\'t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . \\nrepublicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . \\nit\\'s a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process . \\n',\n",
       " b'the tagline on random hearts reads \" in a perfect world , they never would have met . \" \\nin a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie . \\nthe biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production . \\ndutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department . \\nkay is a congresswoman from new hampshire . \\nalthough they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs . \\ndutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair . \\nthe rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process . \\ntwo sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film . \\ndutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare . \\nall the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter . \\nkay\\'s distraction from the film\\'s primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal . \\nthese sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers . \\nrandom hearts\\' two primary characters seem to live in shells . \\nalthough both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other . \\nthere is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships . \\nveteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both . \\nother than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts . \\nhowever , it is also hard to compliment it . \\nhad the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be . \\n',\n",
       " b\"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . \\na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . \\nit is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \\nright from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . \\na pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . \\nafter their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . \\nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . \\nthe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \\nsandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \\nthe most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \\ni always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \\nthere is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \\nbecause the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \\none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \\ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \\nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \\nfirst of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \\nhe's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \\nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \\nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \\nanother mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \\ni'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \\n ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \\nis jackson's character then simply insane ? \\nthat prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \\none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \\nmcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . \\nhow did the prosecution get this information ? \\nhow come he didn't get it ? \\nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \\nthis is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . \\nit's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . \\nat two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . \\nit's all handwaving . \\nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . \\nit's not easy to make a movie about something . \\nthe other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . \\na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"after a stylistic detour with mrs . \\nparker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \\nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \\nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \\nuntil mrs . \\nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \\ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \\nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \\ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \\nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \\nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \\nin short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . \\nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \\njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \\nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . \\nall she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . \\nafter he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . \\nthe other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . \\na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . \\nthey remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \\nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . \\nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . \\nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . \\nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \\nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \\nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \\nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \\nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \\njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \\nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \\nlara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \\nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \\nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \\nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \\ni don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . \\nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \\nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \\nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . \\nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \\n\",\n",
       " b'when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . \\nwoody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he\\'s my favorite . \\neven martin scorsese hasn\\'t had a perfect track record . \\nkevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic \" clerks \" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful \" mallrats . \" \\ni mean , so far the only director who\\'s made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( \" slacker , \" \" dazed and confused , \" \" before sunrise , \" and \" suburbia \" . . . all \\nwhich were great ) . \\nnow , i adore quentin tarantino . \\nhis first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time . \\nbut 1995 just wasn\\'t that good of a year for him . \\nhe made way too many tv appearances . \\nhe mispronounced jackie chan\\'s name on the mtv movie awards . \\nand he made this film . \\n ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) . \\nrobert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one . \\ni\\'ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can\\'t comment on them . \\nbut in this crap ensemble director\\'s film , all four give pitiful efforts . \\npitiful for any director , too . \\nnow in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out . \\ni\\'ve never seen all of \" new york stories , \" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody\\'s one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film . \\nexposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who\\'s a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year\\'s eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel . \\nhe\\'s the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) . \\nthe old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily . \\nas the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile . \\nyea . \\n ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : \\nthe missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt \\nthis one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue . \\nthe situation is so terrible that it\\'s physically painful to watch . \\nthe plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) \\nstuck inside some object in their hotel room . \\nthe witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it . \\nyeah , that\\'s what i said . \\nstupid plot , inane characters who aren\\'t interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully . \\nnot even actually funny for a second . \\nmy rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! \\nthe wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender \\nanother bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on . \\nted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at \" coming back \" ) who are playing sex games . \\nted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon . \\nbut at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much . \\nand david proval has never overacted as much . \\nand it\\'s \" pulp fiction \" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window . \\na masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . . \\nthe misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek \\nwould a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek\\'s navel ? \\nnope . \\nluckily she\\'s on the tv dancing so we get to see her . \\nsurprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . \\nit was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny . \\nbut when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . \\nantonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . \\nbut , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it\\'s more painful than funny . \\nbut the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . \\noh ! \\nthe plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year\\'s party . \\nantonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it \\nwas okay . \\nthe man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) \\nironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . \\nhe plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . \\nthey\\'re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn\\'t light . \\nthey also pay him a lot of cash . \\nthis is so much exactly what this little film is about that it\\'s campy . \\ntim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves \\'cause they\\'ve had hits , major or minor . \\nit took quentin to realize that . \\nbut the thing is , it doesn\\'t seem like he realizes that . \\nif he did , i\\'d give this a good 3 stars . \\nbut this sucked . \\nit was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn\\'t very good . \\nhe starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . \\nthat makes no sense . \\nit\\'s cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . \\nit\\'s long and it\\'s just not very good . \\nhopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . \\nconclusion : what\\'s the moral here ?

       " b'when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better . \\nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . \\nfor new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids . \\nfor people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for . \\nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era . \\nmartin scorsese\\'s taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all . \\nthe movie\\'s protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can\\'t sleep at nights . \\nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . \\nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine\\'s presidential campaign . \\ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre . \\nlosing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street . \\nhe purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict . \\nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi . \\nas many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations . \\nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn\\'t have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \\nwhile de niro\\'s travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america\\'s better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \\nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . \\nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly \" liberated \" betsy . \\neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program can\\'t fool even such idiots like travis . \\nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can\\'t be washed away even by ironic happy end . \\ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader\\'s screenplay into the silver screen . \\nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \\nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \\none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \\ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \\nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \\n',\n",
       " b\"once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . \\nhere we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life . \\nwhat i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . \\ni mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? \\nas was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior . \\nin fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . \\nbut it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . \\na bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . \\nin fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . \\ni haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . \\nit tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker . \\nthe ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . \\njust before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead . \\nflick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . \\nhe heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . \\nflick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . \\nthe most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . \\ncreated by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen . \\nthe bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . \\nthis is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative . \\nthe film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . \\nbut the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters . \\nflick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . \\nbut the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . \\nall of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . \\nin my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . \\nin concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it . \\nwith such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through . \\nit really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . \\nafter a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty . \\n\",\n",

       " b'when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment . \\neven politicians ( ! ) \\ntend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising \" filth \" like pulp fiction . \\nthese [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic\\'s job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be . \\nthusly patch adams isn\\'t a bad film because it\\'s about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it\\'s a bad film because it\\'s a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation . \\nsimilarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it\\'s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess . \\nthe picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world . \\n12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we\\'re all living in a frank capra movie . \\nmeanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the \" movement \" which has apparently begun to grow . \\npay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core . \\nit\\'s as if director mimi leder didn\\'t have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn\\'t \" gutsy \" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for . \\nso the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being \" saved \" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn\\'t quite sure if it\\'s ready to buy into its own utopian blather . \\npay it forward offers \" crowd pleasing \" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr\\'s umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson\\'s earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking \" black hoodlum with a heart of gold \" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ? . \\nhurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a \" nigga \" and says things like \" can you feel me ? \" \\nleave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment . \\n ( maybe spike\\'s flick wasn\\'t so misguided after all ) . \\nthese scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you\\'ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . \\nwhile the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . \\nit\\'s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . \\none scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt\\'s hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . \\nspacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . \\nmaybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he\\'s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . \\nthe usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . \\nin one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i\\'m not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . \\nthe scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it\\'s all very theatrical , especially hunt\\'s performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . \\npay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn\\'t get academy awards . \\nthe picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . \\neven haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . \\nhis acting has become broader , less intimate ; it\\'s as if we can make out the little munchkin\\'s thoughts : \" boy this outta floor em \" . \\nnaturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . \\nnever mind that the two couldn\\'t be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . \\nnevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics . \\nbut oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . \\nthey\\'re so adorable . \\nof course the blame can\\'t all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . \\nthe first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth\\'s possible demise by a crazed meteorite . \\nthe first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . \\ndeep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it\\'s a movie that treats earth\\'s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . \\nthe film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . \\nin pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : \" see my movie isn\\'t as na ?

       " b'let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years . \\ni am not too fond of ted turner\\'s world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight . \\nthe plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show . \\nwhen they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt . \\ni personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back . \\nwhen they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king\\'s real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv . \\nking is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king . \\nafter convincing king that they don\\'t care that his persona isn\\'t real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw\\'s pay-per-view . \\ngee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don\\'t know where to begin . \\nyes , i do . . . \\n1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans . \\nhe thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously . \\nhe actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously . \\ni got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! \\ni know he\\'ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn\\'t meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that\\'s how big an ego bischoff has . \\n2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon\\'s screwing bret \" the hitman \" hart out of the title . \\nthis movie\\'s storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man\\'s wayne and garth thrown in . \\neric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart . \\n3 . \\nthe movie\\'s main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him . \\nno wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! \\n4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? \\ni know wrestling isn\\'t a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end . \\n5 . \\nin the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan . \\nwhat she sees in that freak marilyn manson i\\'ll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king\\'s trainer for sinclair . \\nwouldn\\'t it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? \\ni hate that . \\n6 . \\nlast , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either . \\nthe world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : \\n1 . they\\'re the better promotion . \\n2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers . \\n3 . \\nthey give their fans what they want and don\\'t treat them like idiots . \\n4 . they\\'re winning the ratings and they\\'re the promotion everybody cares about . \\n5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way . \\nthe only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end . \\nand if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars . \\n',\n",
       " b'the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of \" leila , \" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . \\nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui\\'s previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . \\nset in modern-day iran , \" leila \" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . \\nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn\\'t quite as sweet . \\nearlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \\nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn\\'t care at all about having children . \\nnonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \\nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \\nleila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens\\' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn\\'t give her full blessing . \\nthere are no easy answers to be found within \" leila , \" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character\\'s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \\nalmost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law\\'s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \\nmaybe because \" leila \" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \\nleila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \\none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \\nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \\nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \\nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \\nthese \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \\nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \\nrefusing to stay over at her parent\\'s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \\ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \\nsure , the whole second marriage was his mother\\'s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn\\'t he ? \\nin the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \\nunlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \\nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \\nfor all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn\\'t a perfect film . \\non a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \\nand concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \\nmehrjui\\'s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \\ndespite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york\\'s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \\nthe thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila\\'s self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \\nit\\'s difficult to not consider how leila\\'s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \\n',\n",
       " b'quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . \\nafter his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . \\njohn travolta made his come-back and is now one of today\\'s most bankable stars . \\nbruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . \\njackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . \\nmost likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she\\'s never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . \\nthat is , until now . \\njackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . \\nafter mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . \\njackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . \\ndespite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . \\npam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . \\nmore than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . \\ndescribing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can\\'t say much or you spoil it for everyone else . \\ni will tread lightly . \\njackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . \\nthe camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . \\nwe are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . \\nfor a hefty price . \\nms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . \\nhowever , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . \\nthey try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell\\'s buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . \\nthey try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . \\nbut after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell\\'s friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . \\nordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . \\nafter she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . \\nordell doesn\\'t like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . \\nthis scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . \\nrevealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that\\'s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . \\ntarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . \\nhis hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . \\nthey talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . \\nof course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . \\nand perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . \\nof course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . \\nthings are told from one person\\'s perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . \\nthis all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . \\non the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . \\nhowever , this time around it isn\\'t as nearly as impressive or original . \\nthe writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino\\'s use of slang terms offensive . \\nthe story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it\\'s much more easy to understand . \\nhis previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the \" leaps \" in time . \\nperhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel \" rum punch \" by elmore leonard . \\nthe dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . \\nthe cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . \\nand as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . \\nthe acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . \\nthe performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters\\' actions . \\nnothing is quite as it seems , and you can\\'t really tell which side one person is on . \\nthe real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . \\nher poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . \\nwatching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn\\'t know what she was thinking . \\nher face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . \\nbridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . \\ni didn\\'t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham\\'s in boogie nights ) . \\nmichael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . \\nchris tucker has a small , but effective performance . \\nsamuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . \\nbut no matter . . . \\njackson is very strong in his role . \\nrobert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell\\'s perspective clients and friends . \\nrobert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . \\nhe is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . \\njackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . \\nas a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . \\nhowever , one can not help but compare it to tarantino\\'s pulp fiction , and expect great results . \\nwhen compared , it comes up short , but not that short . \\nit\\'s a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . \\nperhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . \\ni can\\'t remember seeing her in anything ( except for a

       " b'in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she\\'ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they\\'ll most enjoy . \\nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \\nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat\\'s true colors begin to shine through . \\nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom\\'s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \\nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom\\'s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what\\'s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \\nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \\nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \\nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \\nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne\\'s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \\non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne\\'s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \\nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \\njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character\\'s determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat\\'s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \\nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \\njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \\ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \\nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \\na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" \\nthat\\'s not to say the men don\\'t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o\\'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \\nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \\ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman\\'s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \\nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \\nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom\\'s chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \\nand it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . \\nthe bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . \\n',\n",

       " b'in the wake of the smashing success of \" rumble in the bronx , \" it\\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \\nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \\nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \\navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \\nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \\nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \\nto be fair , i must admit that i\\'ve never been very fond of \" period-piece \" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \\nperhaps it\\'s because most of those i\\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \\nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \\nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \\nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \\nsurprised ? \\nwell , so was i . \\ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \\nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \\napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \\none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \\nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\\'t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . \\nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \\nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \\nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \\nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \\nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \\nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \\nand so it goes . \\nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \\nlet\\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \\naction . \\nthere\\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \\ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\\'s to be expected . \\nhowever , this isn\\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \\nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \\nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \\nthere\\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \\nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \\nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \\nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \\neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \\namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \\n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \\nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \\nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \\nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\\'s father\\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \\nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \\nit\\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \\nthe picture is crisp and clear . \\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \\n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \\nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\\'s to be expected in this type of film . \\nif you like this kind of movie , you\\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \\nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \\n',\n",

       " b\"i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . \\nit was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . \\nbut of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . \\nyes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . \\nfor all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage . \\nand what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . \\nand all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . \\n`american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year . \\njust how great are their hormones raging ? \\none of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . \\nthe four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . \\nkevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . \\nbut what is the perfect time ? \\nthere is just no way to know , and that frightens him . \\noz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . \\nhe joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . \\nfinch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . \\nso , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess . \\nsuddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him . \\nbut among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . \\nwhen he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through . \\nhe has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge . \\nthis may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . \\nthe one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . \\nthere is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . \\nin fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating . \\nbut i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison . \\nteens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest . \\nbut unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . \\nthese are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . \\ntheir plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . \\nthey know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility . \\nbut almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch . \\n\",\n",

themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch \" last year at merienbad \" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot . \\nno amount of hype , no amount of money can

interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs . \\nwe are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) . \\nwell , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature . \\nlater , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor . \\nin a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word \" gojira \" ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) . \\nwe are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) . \\nhe is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population . \\nhe is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature . \\nin a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica . \\nwell , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york . \\nwhen the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) . \\nthe military , with dr . tatopoulos\\'s help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system . \\nit finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast\\'s picture . \\nthe monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage . \\nworking from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . \\nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . \\nneedless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster\\'s nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn\\'t dead yet ) . \\ni sincerely hope that i\\'ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film . \\ni gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour\\'s wage on this tripe . \\neverything about \" godzilla \" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . \\nthe script ( and let\\'s be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years \" razzie \" award . \\nthe dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos\\' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . \\nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didn\\'t take itself so damn seriously . \\nbut to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . \\nno . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . \\nthe film is bleak and ugly looking . \\ntaking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . \\neverything is ugly and dark . \\nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since \" death wish \" . \\nin an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film

interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : \\n1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? \\n2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? \\ni don\\'t think iguana\\'s have a habit of migrating . \\n3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? \\n4

radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . \\n ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . \\ngodzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . \\n6 . )

on foot . \\n8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . \\n9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can\\'t tear through the park avenue tunnel . \\n10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? \\nmaybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . \\n11 . ) galapagos iguana\\'s actually live in the french polynesian islands ? \\n12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? \\n13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? \\n14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . \\nnew yorkers hate beta cam . \\ni could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . \\ndon\\'t be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of \" america\\'s funniest home videos \" . \\nthe performances in the film are singularly bland . \\nnot one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . \\nthe characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . \\nthe only common occurrence that doesn\\'t take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . \\ngodzilla for the most part is okay . \\nthe design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . \\none thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . \\nnow , i for one can\\'t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . \\na good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . \\nthere is so much wrong with this film that i can\\'t really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my

       " b\"in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . \\ntry too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . \\nin simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . \\nin the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . \\nthere's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . \\nhe chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . \\nthe characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . \\nsimon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall . \\njoe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is . \\nnaturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . \\nin a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small . \\njoe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends . \\nearly on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . \\nboth platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability . \\nthe audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both . \\nfinally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . \\nmark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic . \\nthe script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . ' \\nalong those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . \\nby no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . \\nsimon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . \\nin the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at . \\n\",\n",

       " b'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \\nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \\ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \\ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \\nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \\nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \\nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \\ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \\nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \\nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \\nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \\nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \\nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \\nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \\nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \\ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \\nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \\nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \\nfor some reason , this genre\\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \\nstalked is no exception ( it\\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \\nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \\nstalked\\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \\njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \\nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \\nmaryam d\\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \\nbrooke ( d\\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \\ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \\nto ensure he won\\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \\ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \\nof course not . \\nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \\nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \\nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \\nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\\'s intelligence . \\nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \\nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \\nif you\\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \\n',\n",

       " b\"last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . \\nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \\nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \\nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \\ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \\nthe answer is just about everything . \\nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \\nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \\nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \\nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \\nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \\nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \\nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \\nhe's too much of a joker . \\ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \\nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \\nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \\nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \\nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \\none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \\nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \\nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \\nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \\nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \\nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \\nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \\nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \\nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \\nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \\nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \\ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \\nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \\nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \\nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \\nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \\n\",\n",

\\ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . \\nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . \\nthe buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . \\'s \" losing my religion \" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . \\ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . \\nall of the sequences where we delve into someone\\'s mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . \\nthe first sequence that takes place in stargher\\'s mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i\\'ve ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher\\'s victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . \\nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . \\nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d\\'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . \\nin my opinion , d\\'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - \\nthe newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . \\nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . \\ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . \\nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher\\'s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . \\na sequence where catherine enters stargher\\'s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . \\none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device . \\nas a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . \\nas a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . \\nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . \\nunfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) . \\n',\n",

       " b\"seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 . \\n[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] \\n ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface . \\ni'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . ) \\nas my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? \\nnever mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old . \\nnever mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released . \\nnever mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything . \\nand also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader . \\nbefore we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) . \\nas has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) . \\ngeorge lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically . \\nin media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons . \\nwith this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . . \\nsecond trilogy . . . \\nwell you know what i mean ) . \\nand in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution . \\n[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . \\ncritic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . ' \\nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \\nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \\nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \\nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \\nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \\nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \\nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \\nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \\nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \\nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \\nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \\nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \\ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \\nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \\nbut i digress . \\ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \\nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \\nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \\nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \\nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \\nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \\nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \\nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \\nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \\nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \\nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \\nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \\nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \\ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \\nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \\nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \\nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \\nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \\nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \\nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \\nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \\nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \\ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \\njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \\nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \\nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \\nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \\nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \\nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \\nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \\nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \\nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \\n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \\nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \\nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \\n\",\n",

       " b'preposterous religious action film ( produced by the trinity broadcasting network ) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world ( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh ? ) . \\nmichael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies , while casper van dien ( terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result ) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him . \\nmichael ironside ( great as always , despite the silly film surrounding him ) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael york\\'s character . \\nhere\\'s some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside\\'s character . \\nnow despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene , the filmmakers aren\\'t quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil . \\nhow do they fix that ? \\nmake specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes ! \\nthere are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking . . . \\noooooo scary . \\nbut even that wasn\\'t enough for the filmmakers apparently , as they later have to infer that ironside\\'s character is gay ! \\nit comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense . \\nmy main problem with this film is that , despite the silly story ( which could have been pulled off . . . \\nanything can be made believable if executed correctly ) , the events of the film aren\\'t shown with any sense of urgency or importance . \\nfor example , at one point york\\'s character is declared chancellor of the world or something , and we see one brief , cheesy news report about it . \\nthe movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming , but it never seems that way . \\nthere\\'s no \" world reaction \" to anything . \\nthe omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video . \\nit contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and includes the original theatrical trailer , a documentary on the making of the film , production notes , and cast and crew information . \\nthe documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good ( it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn ) , and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew ( with the exception of michael ironside , unfortunately ) . \\nthe best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed , they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set . \\nmost documentaries tend to overlook this . \\ndoomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed ( you\\'ll remember his documentary from the 1970\\'s called the late great planet earth , where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist ) . \\nhowever , at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side . \\nwhen interviewed they actually have the nerve to say \" ever see raiders of the lost ark ? \\nwell , our film is like that ! \" \\nno it isn\\'t . \\nnot by a long shot . \\n[pg-13] \\n',\n",

\" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ? \\nbah ! \\nwho needs the rules ! \\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \\nand then there\\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \\na free clinic . \\nin the middle of the forest . \\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \\nfor free . \\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ?

       " b'synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion . \\nreluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . \\ncomments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . \\nshe proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . \\nthe clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . \\nnot even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . \\nit\\'s so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it\\'s oddly fascinating . \\nthe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . \\nto this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . \\ni remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . \\ni have never read this book , but i sure hope it\\'s 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . \\nif not , then i\\'m at a complete loss to explain its popularity . \\nthe clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . \\na young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , \\ntramps about in the woods . \\nwith her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience\\'s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . \\nwhat follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla\\'s mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , \\nleggings ) . \\ntearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , \\nas the earthquake slowly recedes . \\na hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . \\ni won\\'t detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . \\nthis movie is really stupid . \\nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . \\nalso , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . \\na blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . \\nshe\\'s of the \" new people \" ; they\\'re of the \" old people \" with \" the memories . \" \\nyep . \\nwe get it . \\nwe get it . \\nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . \\nthe movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . \\nas stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . \\nthe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . \\nthe face-painting that\\'s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . \\nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings . \\nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . \\nadd to this the film\\'s faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you\\'d expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it\\'s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i\\'ve seen in quite a while . \\nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . \\nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . \\nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . \\nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . \\nalthough this may sound gratuitous , i\\'m sure , it\\'s so cheesy that it probably won\\'t bother most people . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . \\nhowever , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . \\ntypically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . \\nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it\\'s so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . \\ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i\\'m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . \\ni shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . . \\n',\n",

\\nchicken pies , of course . \\nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \\nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \\npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \\n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \\nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \\nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \\nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \\nthing is , the film doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \\npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \\nbut they\\'re * chickens * , so it\\'s funny to us . \\nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\\'s films ) succeed is the animators\\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\\'re cribbing . \\nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \\nthere\\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\\'s nationality and film history . \\nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \\nconsider this : since july of last year , i\\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \\nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \\nwhy ? \\nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\\'re parodying that \\'blair witch\\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \\nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \\nif you\\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \\npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \\nenjoyment of this movie doesn\\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \\nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \\nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \\nthe characters\\' inevitable romance doesn\\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \\npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\\'t any help . \\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \\nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \\nthe animation is first-rate . \\nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \\nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\\'ll catch all the details . \\nanyway , the movie\\'s just a boatload of fun . \\nfunnest damn movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\n',\n",

( \" cast away \" ) , and lawrence konner & mark d . rosenthal ( \" mighty joe young \" ) . \\ndirector tim burton\\'s unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly , pointless remake . \\ndavidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror , whom he wisely joins . \\nhowever , he\\'s rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo ( paul giamatti , \" duets \" ) . \\nari ( helena bonham carter , \" fight club \" ) , daughter of the illustrious senator sandar ( david warner , \" titanic \" ) and simian bleeding heart , believes humans should live with apes on equal standing , an unpopular notion . \\nshe takes a liking to leo , who she deems \\'unusual . \\' \\ngeneral thade ( tim roth , \" lucky numbers \" ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race . \\nhe\\'s sweet on ari . \\nit\\'s relatively easy to see where this \\'new\\' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes . \\nthe much ballyhooed \\'surprise\\' ending is a nonsensical let down . \\nan attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , \" driven \" ) giving each other \\'back off\\' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them . \\nthe lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton\\'s squeeze , lisa marie ) . \\nguffaws will also likely greet charlton heston\\'s cameo as thade\\'s father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying . \\nthe only real success of the 2001 \" planet of the apes \" is rick baker\\'s makeup , and even that\\'s an iffy affair . \\nno attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors\\' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work . \\nroth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade\\'s right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers . \\ngiamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal . \\ntim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even\\'s he\\'s undone by some obvious wire work . \\nbonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing . \\nmost of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover . \\nthe ape\\'s city resembles a dank complex of tree houses . \\nthe apes\\' military costumes ( colleen atwood , \" sleepy hollow \" ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka\\'s work on coppola\\'s \" dracula . \" \\nthat oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman\\'s tribal , percussive score . \\n \" planet of the apes \" was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001 , a dismal movie season that\\'s going to the dogs . \\n',\n",
       " b'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \\nokay , it isn\\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \\nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \\nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \\na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \\nbut , the thing is , it isn\\'t . \\nit\\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \\ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \\nbut the species series isn\\'t about the lack of these elements . \\nit\\'s about how much it can get into one film . \\nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \\nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \\nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\\'s needs . \\nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \\naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \\npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \\nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \\nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \\nof course , he isn\\'t the first ever . \\nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \\nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \\nno life lives on it . \\nthat is , no visible life . \\npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \\nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \\nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \\njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \\nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\\'t even remember . \\nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \\nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \\nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \\nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \\npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \\neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \\nhowever , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \\nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \\nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \\nand it has . \\nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \\nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \\nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \\nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \\nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \\nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \\nand it does it quite well . \\nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \\nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \\nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \\nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \\nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \\nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\\'s head being blown off . \\nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \\nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \\nhowever , i tend to disagree . \\nwhat were the alien films about ? \\nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \\nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \\ni didn\\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \\nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \\nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \\nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \\nokay , so it isn\\'t that good . \\ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \\nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \\nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \\noh yeah , and she\\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \\nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \\nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \\njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \\nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \\nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \\nand , of course , justin lazard . \\nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \\nsure , he is wooden , but isn\\'t that what his character is like ? \\nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\\'s acting . \\nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \\nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \\nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \\nhell , i don\\'t even know if i will . \\nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \\ni probably won\\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \\ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \\nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" \\nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \\nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \\n',\n",
       " b'not since oliver stone\\'s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . \\nwhile fincher\\'s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997\\'s the game ) into something like a definitive statement . \\njack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . \\non the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . \\nhere he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . \\nstrangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob\\'s breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy \" tourist \" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . \\nlater , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . \\none night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don\\'t ask-- you\\'ll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn\\'t feel good . \\nit is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . \\nhe moves into tyler\\'s squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are \" don\\'t talk about fight club . \" \\narmed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . \\nresentment creeps into jack\\'s heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . \\nfunded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . \\ntheir initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . \\nit is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . \\nit is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . \\nit\\'s a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . \\nfight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . \\nin the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . \\ni\\'ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don\\'t spring up here and there , and i\\'ll be even more amazed if fincher isn\\'t vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . \\nthey needn\\'t bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher\\'s elaborate attempt at a joke . \\ntyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . \\nin this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won\\'t . \\nhopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won\\'t spoil the joke for the rest of us . \\n',\n",
       " b'the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \\nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment\\'s notice . \\nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \\nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \\nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \\nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \\nwhat if he\\'s also able to think on his feet ? \\nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \\nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\\'s the negotiator . \\nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \\nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \\nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\\'s office . \\ni don\\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \\nalthough it wouldn\\'t surprise me if he did . \\nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \\nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \\nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \\nalthough roman\\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \\njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \\nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \\nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \\nhow can we believe he\\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \\nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\\'s acting ability . \\nalmost every time he\\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \\nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \\nhis is an interesting character . \\nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \\n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \\nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \\nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \\nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \\nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \\ngray really lucked out with this cast . \\ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \\nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \\nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \\nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \\nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \\nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \\nfortunately , this doesn\\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \\nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \\nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \\nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \\nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \\nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \\nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \\nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\\'s reality . \\nwe\\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \\nas an audience , we\\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \\nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \\n',\n",

       " b'the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . \\none particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . \\nunder the \" saluting \" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . \\nthe salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . \\nin any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . \\nalmost at the very beginning of the general\\'s daughter , we see a general\\'s motorcade passing a work detail . \\neveryone salutes . \\nit looked impressive , but it just wasn\\'t right . \\nthat little bit showed me that someone either didn\\'t do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene . \\nin fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie . \\nwhat results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn\\'t right . \\nthe first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example . \\npaul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army\\'s criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale . \\nprior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn\\'t the unscrupulous supply sergeant he\\'s supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living . \\nso ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we\\'ll just say that it involves propellers ) . \\nbrenner then receives new orders when the commanding general\\'s daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base\\'s training ranges . \\nhe is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder . \\nwhat i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . \\nit gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he\\'s a little cocky . \\ndoes the arms subplot turn up later ? \\nno , so why add this extra running time to the film ? \\nthe answer : it looked cool . \\nor how about the \" atmosphere \" ? \\nthe beginning of the general\\'s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . \\nnice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn\\'t matter , for when the film\\'s plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . \\nno attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . \\ndid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? \\ninstead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . \\nthe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . \\nas i\\'ve already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn\\'t jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . \\nbrenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest \" yes , sir \" s i\\'ve ever heard . \\nhe even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general\\'s daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . \\nsunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . \\nboth characters are protagonists , but it\\'s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . \\ni could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , \" let\\'s do it again , but this time , i want more . \" \\ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . \\nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general\\'s aide , colonel fowler . \\ni swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . \\na far cry from his days as linc in \" the mod squad \" , i can\\'t help but think he was acting from west\\'s direction . \\na couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . \\nthe only two actors who seem to have escaped west\\'s influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth\\'s mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . \\nwoods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people\\'s minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . \\nhutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn\\'t overacting . \\ni haven\\'t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i\\'ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . \\nthe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . \\nevery time we\\'re presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it\\'s the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . \\ninstead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . \\nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . \\nwould\\'ve been over in a half hour . \\nthe film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . \\nliterally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . \\nthey both seem kind of happy . \\nmaybe they were driving away from simon west . \\n',\n",
       " b'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \\nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \\nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \\nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \\ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \\nit\\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \\nart ! \" ) , \\nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \\nbecause we\\'re constantly made aware that we\\'re watching a play or a movie , it\\'s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer\\'s ideas . \\nthey\\'re not real , sympathetic , or believable . \\ni\\'m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \\ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \\none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \\nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \\nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \\nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \\nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \\nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn\\'t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \\ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \\nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren\\'t bilingual ) . \\nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it\\'s different , ( b ) it\\'s not like anything they\\'ve seen before , and ( c ) it\\'s pretentious . \\nfor everyone else , it\\'s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \\n',\n",

       " b\"starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . \\nnot that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . \\nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . \\nsure . \\nwilliam baldwin isn't a bad actor . \\nunfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . \\ni'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . \\nif it was the latter , it worked . \\ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . \\nwhich is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . \\nalthough to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . \\nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? \\nwell , i'm glad you asked that question . \\ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . \\nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? \\nby the end of the movie you won't care . \\nthe story is so contrived it isn't funny . \\nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . \\nwho's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . \\nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . \\nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . \\nif i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . \\nas for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . \\nunfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . \\nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . \\nit's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . \\nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection . \\nthe similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings . \\nit would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) . \\nanother more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time . \\nthis is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) . \\nwhat helps final destination is its unique premise . \\nunlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper . \\nthis being already has predestined when and how you will die . \\naccording to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses . \\nwhat is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it . \\nthe only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ? \\nthis dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers . \\nalex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors . \\nalex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off . \\nshortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal . \\nhowever , death isn't through with them yet . \\nit gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again . \\nthe plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while . \\nsome scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock . \\ncreativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films . \\nsure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining . \\nalso director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously . \\nhe knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) . \\nthe myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie . \\nand from this , i had a great time watching the movie . \\n\",\n",

       " b'because the press screening of \" planet of the apes \" was one day past last issue\\'s deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . \\nthe chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg\\'s character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . \\nto those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? \\nthis is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . \\ntim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . \\nfor the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated \" mars attacks ! \" \\n ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage \" mars attacks ! \" \\ntrading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . \\nburton\\'s re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . \\nthe apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . \\nlike astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . \\nas for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . \\nfrom his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . \\nso leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . \\nas for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . \\nhe doesn\\'t want to lead humanity and he isn\\'t looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . \\nas a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . \\nthe surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn\\'t nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . \\nfor the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . \\nthe 1968 \" apes \" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . \\nbut viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . \\nthe 2001 \" planet of the apes \" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . \\nit also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that\\'s nothing to complain about . \\n',\n",
       " b'synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband . \\nafter uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers . \\ncomments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time . \\nthough it doesn\\'t present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person\\'s murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it . \\nit is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence . \\nthis film\\'s violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory . \\nfor those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour . \\nnicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities . \\nas tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants . \\nserving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california . \\ncalifornia , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character . \\nthe real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare . \\nstormare played the \" really , really evil guy \" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable . \\nhis performance is very chilling . \\n8 mm\\'s success may hardly be surprising . \\nit was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin . \\nbefore directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down . \\n8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience\\'s eyes . \\n8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back . \\nlike seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater . \\nwelles is searching for answers . \\nhow could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? \\nwhen confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons . \\nhe just enjoys it . \\nthat , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist . \\na couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) . \\none , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film . \\nyes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles\\' caliber has probably encountered awful things before . \\nsecond , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient . \\nhe discovers , for example , the victim\\'s diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before . \\nfinally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film . \\ndespite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story . \\none of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film . \\nhe pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him . \\nhe then leaves the building and calls the victim\\'s mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action . \\nthe entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged . \\nrarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did . \\n8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart . \\nthis is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people . \\nif you\\'re prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation . \\n']"
